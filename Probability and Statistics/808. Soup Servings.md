# **[Soup Servings](https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a scenario where two types of soups are poured from two bowls represented by `A` and `B`. In each serving, you can pour a variable amount of soup from each bowl into a single serving bowl, and we need to determine the probability that the served soup will be from bowl `A` after a series of servings until one bowl is emptied. This involves understanding the geometric distribution of the servings and the recursive nature of the serving process.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to simulate the serving process. The function will take the remaining quantities of soup `A` and `B` and calculate the probabilities for different serving choices:

1. **Base Case**: If `A <= 0` and `B <= 0`, the probability is `0.5` as both bowls are empty simultaneously.  
   If `A <= 0`, the probability is `0` because bowl `B` won.  
   If `B <= 0`, the probability is `1` because bowl `A` won.  

2. **Recursion**: From the current state `(A, B)`, we call the probability function for the next states by making the following servings:
   - Pour 100ml from A and 0ml from B
   - Pour 75ml from A and 25ml from B
   - Pour 50ml from A and 50ml from B
   - Pour 25ml from A and 75ml from B  

3. **Memoization**: We will use a hashmap to store already computed probabilities for the states to avoid redundant calculations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the maximum volume for either bowl, due to the recursive calls and memoization.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(N^2) for the memoization storage.
