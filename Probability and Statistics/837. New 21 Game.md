# **[New 21 Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The New 21 Game is a variation of a card game where players can draw cards to accumulate points without exceeding a certain threshold. In this game, any player can draw cards until they reach or exceed a score of `K`. If they draw cards and their total score exceeds `K`, they lose. The goal is to determine the probability of having a score in the range [K, N] when the player stops drawing cards. Given that drawing a card adds a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive) to the current score, we need to compute the probability of ending the game in a desired range.

### **🚀 Approach**  
To compute the probability, we can utilize dynamic programming:
1. We maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the probability of reaching score `i`.
2. We can iterate through possible scores `0` to `N`, and for each score, evaluate how likely we are to reach the subsequent scores based on drawing a card.
3. The probability mass from scores that can lead to `K` to `N` will be the sum of previous scores that could add up to their values (by adding a card between 1 to 10) without exceeding `K`.
4. We also maintain a rolling sum to efficiently calculate the probabilities over the last ten draws, avoiding a nested loop.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the maximum score since we iterate through all scores from `0` to `N`.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), since we maintain a dp array of size `N + 1`.

## **2️⃣ LeetCode Submission**  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {
        if (K == 0 || N >= K + W) return 1.0;

        vector<double> dp(N + 1, 0.0);
        dp[0] = 1.0; // Base case: score 0 with 100% probability.

        double rollingSum = dp[0]; // Initialize the rolling sum with dp[0].

        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (i <= K - 1)
                dp[i] = rollingSum / W; // If current score is less than K, this is the transition.

            // Update rolling sum to include the last W scores
            if (i >= W) 
                rollingSum -= dp[i - W]; 

            rollingSum += dp[i]; // Include the current score in rolling sum.
        }

        double result = 0.0;
        for (int i = K; i <= N; i++) {
            result += dp[i]; // Sum up probabilities from K to N
        }

        return result;
    }
};  
```
