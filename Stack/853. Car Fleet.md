# **[Car Fleet](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves simulating cars that are moving towards a destination at different speeds. When slower cars encounter faster cars, they can form a "fleet," which is a group of cars moving together at the same speed. The goal is to determine how many distinct fleets will arrive at the destination.

To solve this, we need to know:
- The positions and speeds of the cars.
- The destination's position.

When two cars meet, the faster car catches the slower one and they form a fleet. We must carefully track the lead car's speed after a capture, as it dictates the fleet's speed.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Cars**: First, sort the cars based on their starting positions.
2. **Calculate Time to Destination**: For each car, compute the time it takes to reach the destination using the formula `time = (destination - position) / speed`.
3. **Track Fleets**: We can traverse from the last car to the first and compare the time it takes for the current car to reach the destination with the last fleet's time. If the current car's time is greater than or equal to the last fleet‚Äôs time, it means it will catch up and join the fleet.
4. **Count the Fleets**: If a car cannot catch up to the last fleet, it starts a new fleet.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting the cars, plus O(n) for traversing them. Overall: O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `car_fleet.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `CarFleet` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
