# **[Beautiful Towers II](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-towers-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we have a series of tower heights represented by an array. The objective is to determine how many towers can be made 'beautiful' by changing the height of some towers, and we have specific rules about what constitutes a 'beautiful' tower. A tower is deemed beautiful if it is neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing when compared to its neighboring towers. Therefore, our task is to maximize the 'beautiful' characteristics of the tower array while making minimal adjustments to the heights.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle this problem, we can take the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start by reading the input heights of the towers.
2. **Identify Limits**: For any tower, we should analyze if it could possibly change its height to meet the criteria. This can be based on the heights of its neighbors.
3. **Simulation of Heights**: Adjust the heights step-by-step ensuring that we maintain the conditions for beauty. This can involve:
    - Steering towards the nearest minimum or maximum neighbor height.
    - Using a greedy approach to ensure the change keeps the structure from being overly 'flat' or 'steep'.
4. **Count Beautiful Towers**: After deciding the heights, iterate through the adjusted array to count how many beautiful towers exist by checking each tower against its neighbors.

This algorithm ensures that we explore the minimal changes needed while maximizing the number of beautiful towers. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of towers since we process each tower a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we only use a fixed number of variables for tracking the maximum and minimum heights.
