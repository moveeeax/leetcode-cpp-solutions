# **[Find Building Where Alice and Bob Can Meet](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-building-where-alice-and-bob-can-meet/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about finding a building that lies in the middle (or average) of heights between Alice and Bob. Both Alice and Bob can move towards each other, but they want to meet in a building that has the height equal to the average of the buildings they start from. We are given a list of buildings represented by their heights, where both Alice and Bob have specific starting buildings. The goal is to find a building that satisfies their requirements.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding the Average Requirement**: To find the meeting point, we need to determine the average height between the areas where Alice and Bob start. 
2. **Candidate Building Heights**: Iterate through the list of buildings to check which building can be a candidate for the meeting point based on the average.
3. **Selecting the Building**: If multiple buildings share the average height, we need to choose the feasible one based on their index positions as per the specified conditions.
4. **Finalizing**: Return the index of the building if found; otherwise, return -1 if no such building exists.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of buildings. We only need a single pass through the buildings to find the result.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of input size.
