# **[Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to form the smallest subsequence of distinct characters from the given string `s`. The subsequence must appear in the same order as they appear in `s`, while ensuring that all characters are unique. The challenge lies in maintaining the ordering of characters while ensuring that they are included only once.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: We use a `stack` to build the result and a `set` or an array to track which characters have been added to the stack to ensure they are distinct.
2. **Iterate through the string**: 
   - For each character, check if it is already included in the result using the set/array.
   - If it's not included:
     - Compare it with the top character of the stack. If the current character is smaller and the top of the stack is greater than the current character, and if the character at the top of the stack appears later in the string (i.e., it can be found again), then pop the stack.
     - Push the current character onto the stack and mark it as included.
3. **Construct the result**: After processing the string, the stack will contain the characters of the smallest subsequence, which can then be converted to a string to return as the output.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, as each character is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), assuming the character set size is constant (which is the case for lowercase letters).

            // Maintain the order and distinct property
            while (!stk.empty() && stk.top() > s[i] && lastIndex[stk.top() - 'a'] > i) {
                inStack[stk.top() - 'a'] = false; // Mark the top character as not in stack
                stk.pop();  // Pop from stack
            }
            stk.push(s[i]);  // Push current character
            inStack[ch] = true; // Mark as in stack
        }

        string result = ""; // To store the resulting subsequence
        while (!stk.empty()) {
            result += stk.top(); // Construct the result 
            stk.pop();
        }
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end()); // Reverse to get the right order
