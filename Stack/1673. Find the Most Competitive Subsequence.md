# **[Find the Most Competitive Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-competitive-subsequence/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the most competitive subsequence of a given array `nums` of size `n` with a required length `k`. A subsequence is deemed more competitive than another subsequence if it appears lexicographically smaller. To achieve this, we need to effectively choose `k` numbers from `nums` such that the chosen numbers maintain their relative order and form the smallest possible number pattern.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Using a Stack**: We can utilize a stack to maintain potential candidates for our subsequence while traversing the array.
2. **Greedy Choice**: We need to iterate through each number in the array:
   - If the current number is smaller than the top of the stack and if removing the top of the stack does not prevent us from building a sequence of length `k`, we pop the stack.
   - We always ensure that the stack never grows larger than `k`, which means we only add to the stack if its size is less than `k`.
3. **Final Result**: After processing all numbers, we simply take the first `k` elements from the stack to form our final subsequence.

This approach leverages the stack's LIFO nature to efficiently construct the most competitive subsequence while maintaining a linear time complexity.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the list at most twice, once for pushing and once for popping.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) - The stack holds at most `k` elements.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostCompetitive(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<int> stack; // Stack to hold the most competitive numbers
        int n = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // While the current number is less than the last number in the stack
            // and we can still remove elements from the stack
            while (!stack.empty() && stack.back() > nums[i] && stack.size() + (n - i - 1) >= k) {
                stack.pop_back();
            }
            // If we can add more elements to the stack, do it
            if (stack.size() < k) {
                stack.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        return vector<int>(stack.begin(), stack.begin() + k); // Return only the first k elements
    }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `find_the_most_competitive_subsequence.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()` and handle input/output.  
3. **Include necessary headers**: `<vector>`  
4. **Implement input parsing and output displaying**.  
5. **Compile and run the program**.
