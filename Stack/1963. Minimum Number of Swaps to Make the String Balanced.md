# **[Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-string-balanced/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of swaps required to balance a string consisting of brackets, we must ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that they are properly ordered. The given string must have an equal number of opening and closing brackets to be balanced. If there is an imbalance, we cannot balance the string through swaps.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Imbalance**: As we traverse the string, we should keep a count of the "balance" which increments for each opening bracket and decrements for each closing bracket. A perfect balance will maintain a zero value at the end of our traversal if the string is composed of valid pairs.
  
2. **Identify Swaps**: Whenever the balance number becomes negative, it indicates that there are more closing brackets than opening ones at that position. This imbalance directly translates into requiring swaps to correct the order.
  
3. **Calculate Swaps**: We can count the number of times the balance goes negative, which indicates the maximum depth of imbalance. Each negative balance needs to be corrected with a swap.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string because we need to traverse the entire string once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because we're using a constant amount of additional space for the balance counter.

            } else {
                balance--;
            }
            // If balance goes negative, we need a swap
            if (balance < 0) {
                swaps++;
                balance = 0; // Reset balance after a swap
            }
        }
        return swaps;
    }
