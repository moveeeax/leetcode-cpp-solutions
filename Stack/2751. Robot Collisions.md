# **[Robot Collisions](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-collisions/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves navigating a series of robots represented by a string where each character indicates the direction in which each robot is moving: `'L'` for left and `'R'` for right. The goal is to simulate these robots' movements and determine their final positions after all collisions have been resolved.  

A collision occurs when a robot moving right (`'R'`) meets a robot moving left (`'L'`). In such a scenario, both robots will collide and will be removed from the simulation. If there are multiple robots, the ones that remain will simply continue moving in their respective directions until they either collide with another robot or reach the edge.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, utilize a stack to simplify the collision simulation process. The stack will help keep track of the robots' positions and directions:

1. Iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is `'R'`, simply push it into the stack as it moves to the right.
   - If the character is `'L'`:
     - Check the top of the stack to see if it is `'R'` indicating a collision. If so, they will both be removed (pop the stack).
     - If the stack is empty or the top character is also `'L'`, push `'L'` to the stack since there is no collision.
     
2. Continue this process until all characters are processed.

3. After processing all robots, convert the stack back into a string which represents the final positions of the robots.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We traverse each character exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, where all robots are moving in one direction with no collisions.

```cpp
class RobotCollisions {
public:
    string handleCollisions(string directions) {
        // Use a stack to manage the robots and simulate the collisions
        vector<char> stack;

        for (char dir : directions) {
            if (dir == 'R') {
                // If the robot is moving right, push it onto the stack
                stack.push_back(dir);
            } else {
                // The robot is moving left
                while (!stack.empty() && stack.back() == 'R') {
                    // A collision occurs between R and L
                    stack.pop_back(); // Both robots are removed
                }
                if (stack.empty() || stack.back() == 'L') {
                    // No collision or the top robot is also heading left
                    stack.push_back(dir); // Push L onto stack
                }
            }
        }

        // Convert the stack back into a string
        return string(stack.begin(), stack.end());
    }
};

### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `robot_collisions.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `RobotCollisions` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
