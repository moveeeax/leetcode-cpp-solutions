# **[The Number of Weak Characters in the Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-weak-characters-in-the-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves players in a game, each characterized by two attributes: `attack` and `defense`. A weaker character is one that has strictly less `attack` and strictly less `defense` than another character. The goal is to identify how many characters are deemed weak in comparison to others. 

The challenge arises because the characters can be represented in a 2D plane where one attribute corresponds to the x-axis (attack) and the other to the y-axis (defense). Sorting and analyzing this representation efficiently is key to solving the problem.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem optimally:
1. **Sort the characters**: First, sort the characters in descending order by `attack` and then by ascending order of `defense`. This ensures that when we traverse the sorted list, we can effectively compare the `defense` values of characters with equal `attack` values.
2. **Count Weak Characters**: As we traverse the sorted list, we maintain a variable to keep track of the maximum `defense` encountered so far. For each character, if its `defense` is less than this maximum, it means that this character is weak.
3. **Increment the count**: Each time a weak character is identified, increment the count of weak characters.
4. **Return the count**: Finally, return the total number of weak characters.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the characters.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are only using constant space apart from the input data.
