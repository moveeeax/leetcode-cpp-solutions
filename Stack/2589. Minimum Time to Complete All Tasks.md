# **[Minimum Time to Complete All Tasks](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-all-tasks/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum time required to complete a set of tasks, each with an associated time to complete and a dependency relationship among them. Each task can only be started when all its prerequisites are fulfilled. This forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure where tasks are nodes and dependencies are edges. The task is to find the longest path in this graph because the completion of all tasks depends on the sequence that fulfills dependencies. 

The crucial aspect here is that while a task takes a certain time to complete, other tasks may need to be completed before starting it. We need to traverse through this graph in a way that ensures we adhere to the dependencies while calculating the total time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: Construct a graph using adjacency lists to represent dependencies, and also maintain an array to track the in-degree (number of prerequisites) of each task.
2. **Topological Sorting**: Use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. This involves repeatedly removing nodes that have zero in-degrees and updating the in-degrees of their children. This helps in determining the order in which tasks can be processed.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: While performing the topological sort, maintain a `completion_time` array where each entry indicates the earliest time a task can be completed. For each task‚Äîthat is currently being processed‚Äîupdate its children's completion times to ensure they represent the longest path from that task.
4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value in the `completion_time` array at the end will signify the total time required to finish all tasks.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the number of tasks and m is the number of dependencies. This is because each task and dependency is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for storing the graph and in-degrees.
