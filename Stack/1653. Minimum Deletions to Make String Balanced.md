# **[Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-balanced/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to make a string consisting of the characters '0's and '1's "balanced." A balanced string should not have more '1's on the left of any position compared to '0's. The question is to find out the minimum number of deletions needed to achieve this balance. The key insight here is that for each '1' we have, we need to ensure that there are sufficient '0's on its right to maintain balance.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialize Counters**: Start with a count of `zeroes` and `ones` starting from the end of the string. This helps in determining how many deletions are necessary to ensure balance as we iterate through the string.  
2. **Traverse the String**: Loop through each character of the string:
   - If it's '0', increment the `zeroes` counter because it can potentially help balance the '1's.
   - If it's '1', calculate how many deletions are needed to maintain balance. The number of deletions required is the maximum between current `ones` and the `zeroes` observed so far (because for each '1', we might need a '0' on the right).
3. **Track Minimum Deletions**: Maintain a variable that keeps track of the minimal deletions required during the traversal.
4. **Final Count**: The result will be the minimum of the total `ones` count and the maximum deletions encountered during the iteration.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we are making a single pass through the string.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), using only a few integer variables for counting.
