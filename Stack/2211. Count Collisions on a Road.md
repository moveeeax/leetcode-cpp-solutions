# **[Count Collisions on a Road](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-collisions-on-a-road/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to calculate the number of collisions on a road, given a string representing vehicles moving in different directions. Each character in the string acts as a vehicle's representation where:
- `'L'` indicates a vehicle moving left,
- `'R'` indicates a vehicle moving right,
- `'S'` indicates a vehicle standing still. 

A collision occurs when:
- A right-moving vehicle (`'R'`) encounters a left-moving vehicle (`'L'`), leading to both vehicles changing their direction to stand still (`'S'`).
- A standing vehicle (`'S'`) moving into a collision from either side.

The goal is to determine how many collisions will happen by examining the string of vehicles. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To find the total number of collisions:
1. First, we initialize a counter to keep track of the number of collisions.
2. We iterate through the string to count the vehicles in the following manner:
   - When we encounter `'R'`, we continue until we meet either `'S'` or `'L'`, counting how many vehicles were involved in the collision:
     - If `S` is encountered, it adds to the collision count, converting all relevant characters to `'S'`.
     - If `L` is encountered, it also finishes the collision counting since it indicates a direct collision.
3. After processing the rightward vehicles, we ensure:
   - Any sequences of `'L'` at the beginning or end are treated appropriately, since they cannot be involved in any collision unless there were right-turning vehicles beforehand.

This algorithm effectively counts collisions with a single pass through the string, making it efficient.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we traverse it once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a few integer variables for counting and do not require any additional data structures.
