# **[Minimum Additions to Make Valid String](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-additions-to-make-valid-string/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the number of parentheses we need to add to a given string of parentheses so that it becomes valid. In a valid string of parentheses, every opening parenthesis `(` must be closed by a corresponding closing parenthesis `)` and they must be properly nested. The goal is to find the minimum additions needed to achieve this validity.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple counter to track the balance of parentheses. We will iterate through each character in the string:

1. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0, which will track the net count of opening and closing parentheses.
2. Traverse each character in the string:
   - If we encounter an opening parenthesis `(`, we increase the `balance`.
   - If we encounter a closing parenthesis `)`, we decrease the `balance`.
   - If `balance` becomes negative after decrementing (meaning we have more closing parentheses than opening), we will need to add an opening parenthesis for every unmatched closing parenthesis.
3. After processing the entire string, if there is a remaining positive `balance`, it indicates the number of unmatched opening parentheses, which means we need to add that many closing parentheses.
4. The result will be the total number of additions required: unmatched closing parentheses + unmatched opening parentheses.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we make a single pass through the string.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a fixed amount of additional space for variables.

                    additions++; // need an opening bracket
                } else {
                    balance--; // match a closing bracket
                }
