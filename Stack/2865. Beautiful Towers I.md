# **[Beautiful Towers I](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-towers-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around rearranging the heights of towers to achieve a "beautiful" configuration, where the height of each tower is greater than the previous one. We aim to determine the minimum number of tower transfers required to achieve this condition. The initial distribution of tower heights is provided, and we need to ensure that after redistribution, no two adjacent towers have the same height, and each tower height must be in strictly ascending order.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Maximum Requirements**: The tallest tower in the current distribution sets the maximum limit for allowed heights. Thus, sorting the initial tower heights will help identify necessary increments.
   
2. **Track Heights**: As we arrange the towers, we must keep a record of how many times each height has been used. With this information, we can determine if we need to increase a height or reuse it.

3. **Redistribution Algorithm**:
   - First, sort the tower heights.
   - Initialize a variable to track the previously assigned height.
   - Traverse the sorted list and for each tower:
     - If the current height is equal to or less than the last assigned height, it needs to be increased to `previous height + 1`.
     - Record the new height and count each increment.

4. **Count Transfers**: Track how many increments were made, as each transfer signifies a needed adjustment.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the array.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for variables used, since the sorting can be done in-place.

                int newHeight = lastHeight + 1;  // Increase current height
                transfers += newHeight - height;  // Count the transfers needed
                lastHeight = newHeight;  // Update last assigned height
            } else {
                lastHeight = height;  // Update last assigned height
