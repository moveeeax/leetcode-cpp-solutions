# **[Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around the concept of calculating the "stock span" for a sequence of stock prices. The stock span for a particular day is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (including the current day) up to the current day where the stock price was less than or equal to the price on the current day. This means that we need to efficiently calculate this span factor as we read through the stock prices incrementally. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize a stack data structure to keep track of previous stock prices along with their corresponding spans. This allows us to effectively compute the span in O(1) amortized time complexity for each price, making our overall time complexity O(n).

1. **Initialize** a stack that will store pairs of prices and their corresponding spans.
2. **Iterate** through each price:
   - While the stack is not empty and the price is greater than or equal to the price at the top of the stack, we pop the stack. This reflects the fact that those days contribute to the span of the current day.
   - If the stack is empty after this, it means there are no previous days with a price greater than the current price, thus the span is the index + 1 (current day + 1).
   - If the stack is not empty, the span will be the difference between the current index and the index of the last price on the stack.
   - Push the current price and its computed span onto the stack.
3. **Return** the array of spans.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of prices processed since each price is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we need to store the stack of prices and spans.

public:

    int next(int price) {
        int span = 1; // starting span for the current price
        while (!stk.empty() && stk.top().first <= price) {
            span += stk.top().second; // accumulate span
            stk.pop(); // pop prices that are less than or equal to current price
        }
        stk.push({price, span}); // push current price and its span onto the stack
        return span; // return the span for the current price
    }
};

### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `StockSpanner.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `StockSpanner` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
