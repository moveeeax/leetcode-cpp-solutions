# **[My Calendar II](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of this problem is to design a calendar that can handle overlapping events with an additional constraint: no triple bookings are allowed. This means we can accommodate two overlapping events at a time, but if a new event overlaps with both, it must be rejected.

To achieve this, we need to efficiently store the intervals of the events and check for overlaps when new events are added. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structure**: We'll use a vector to keep track of the booked events, which we will represent as pairs of integers: each pair represents the start and end of the booked interval.
2. **Overlapping Check**: When a new event is booked, we need to check against all existing events to see if it overlaps with them. We also need to ensure that it doesn't create a situation where three events overlap.
3. **Event Management**: For every new booking, loop through the existing events and keep track of whether this new event causes any triple bookings.

We will implement this logic in the `book` function, which will:
- Add the event if no triple overlaps are detected.
- Return `false` if a triple booking occurs.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of bookings. This happens when we need to check overlaps for every new booking with all existing bookings.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the list of booked events.

        for (const auto& booking : bookings) {
            if (start < booking.second && end > booking.first) {
                overlapCount++;
                if (overlapCount == 2) {
                    return false; // Avoid triple booking
                }
            }
        }
        bookings.push_back({start, end});
        return true; // Booking successful
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `MyCalendarII.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `MyCalendarThree` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

    cout << myCalendar.book(10, 20) << endl; // returns true
    cout << myCalendar.book(15, 25) << endl; // returns true
    cout << myCalendar.book(20, 30) << endl; // returns true
    cout << myCalendar.book(5, 15) << endl;  // returns false, would create a triple booking
    return 0;
