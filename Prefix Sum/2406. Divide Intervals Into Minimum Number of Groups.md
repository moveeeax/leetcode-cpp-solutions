# **[Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-intervals-into-minimum-number-of-groups/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to divide a list of intervals into the minimum number of groups, such that no two intervals in the same group overlap. An interval is represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the start and the second integer is the end of the interval. The goal is to find out how many groups are necessary to ensure that all intervals in each group do not overlap.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize a greedy algorithm by employing a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently manage the end times of the intervals in our groups. Here are the steps:
1. **Sort the Intervals**: Begin by sorting the intervals based on their start times. This will allow us to process each interval in the order of their appearance.
2. **Use a Min-Heap**: Maintain a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the end times of the current groups. If the start time of the current interval is greater than the minimum end time in the heap, it means we can merge this interval into that group. Hence, we remove that end time from the heap and add the end time of the current interval.
3. **Add to Heap**: If the start time of the current interval does not fit into any existing group (i.e., it overlaps with the earliest ending group), we will need to create a new group. Therefore, we simply add the end time of the current interval to the heap.
4. **Result**: The size of the heap at the end of processing all intervals represents the minimum number of groups needed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting the intervals takes O(n log n), and each insertion and removal operation on the min-heap takes O(log n). Thus, the total is O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - In the worst case, we might store all end times in the heap if all intervals are disjoint.

        for (auto& interval : intervals) {
            // If the current interval can fit into the earliest ending group, pop that group's end time
            if (!minHeap.empty() && interval[0] > minHeap.top()) {
                minHeap.pop();
            }
            // Add the end time of the current interval to the heap
            minHeap.push(interval[1]);
        }
        
        // The size of the min-heap represents the number of groups we need
        return minHeap.size();
    }
