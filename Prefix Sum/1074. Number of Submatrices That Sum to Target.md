# **[Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-submatrices-that-sum-to-target/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is asking for the count of all submatrices in a given 2D matrix that sum up to a specific target value. A submatrix is defined by the top-left and bottom-right corners. We can leverage techniques from prefix sums to effectively calculate the sums of submatrices more efficiently rather than computing them individually.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Iterate Over Rows**: We start by choosing two rows as boundaries for our submatrices. The idea is to fix two rows at a time and calculate the sums of elements for columns between these two rows.
2. **Use a HashMap**: As we compute the cumulative sums for the columns in the selected rows, we will maintain a HashMap (or unordered_map) to keep track of how many times we have seen a particular sum. The key idea is to check if the difference between the cumulative sum and the target has been seen before in the HashMap.
3. **Count Valid Submatrices**: For each cumulative sum computed, if the current sum minus the target exists in the HashMap, it means there are several rectangular regions whose sum matches the target.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. This is because for each pair of rows, we compute sums for all columns.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), as we may need storage for cumulative sums in the HashMap for the columns.
