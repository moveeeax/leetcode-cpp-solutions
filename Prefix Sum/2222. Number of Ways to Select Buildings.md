# **[Number of Ways to Select Buildings](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-select-buildings/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem seeks to determine the number of ways to select buildings arranged in a line, given a specific constraint. Specifically, buildings can only be selected if they are not adjacent. The configuration of buildings is provided as a binary string where '1' indicates the presence of a building and '0' indicates its absence. The goal is to compute the total number of valid selections of these buildings.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the number of ways to select buildings up to a given index.
2. **Indices Management**: Iterate through the string while maintaining two states: the number of ways to select buildings when including the current building and excluding it.
3. **Recurrence Relation**: 
   - If the current building is '1', we can choose to select this building, which means we add the number of ways we could select buildings excluding the previous one (i.e., `dp[i-2]`). 
   - Additionally, we can choose not to select it, which adds the number of ways we could select buildings including the previous one (i.e., `dp[i-1]`).
4. **Final Calculation**: The result will be derived from the last element of the DP array, reflecting the total number of ways to select the buildings as per the given constraints.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is due to the single pass through the string to fill the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only need a few variables to maintain the counts rather than an entire DP array.

                curr = (curr + prev) % mod; // Select this building (assuming previous cannot be selected)
                prev = (temp + prev) % mod; // Not select this building
            } else {
                prev = curr; // Reset prev if current is '0'

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `number_of_ways_to_select_buildings.cpp`.
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`.  
3. **Include necessary headers**.  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**.  
5. **Compile and run the program**.
