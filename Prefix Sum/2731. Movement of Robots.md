# **[Movement of Robots](https://leetcode.com/problems/movement-of-robots/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem presents a scenario with robots that can move in a one-dimensional space. Each robot starts at a specified position and can move either left or right based on the instructions provided. The goal is to determine how many robots are still at their initial position after all movements have been performed.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
- **Initial Setup**: We will keep track of the positions of all robots using their starting points, which are provided in the `positions` array. The movements for each robot are provided in the `move` array.
- **Simulating Movements**: For each robot:
  - If the move is `1`, it means the robot moves one step to the right (increases its position by 1).
  - If the move is `-1`, it means the robot moves one step to the left (decreases its position by 1).
- **Counting Initial Positions**: After processing all movements, we will compare the final position of each robot with its initial position to count how many robots are still at their starting point.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of robots, since we iterate through each robot once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only use a fixed amount of space to store temporary variables, regardless of the input size.

            } else {
                // Calculate the final position of the robot after movement
                positions[i] += move[i];
