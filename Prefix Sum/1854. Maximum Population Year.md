# **[Maximum Population Year](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-population-year/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to determine the year during which the population was at its maximum across a range of years, given the birth and death years of individuals. Each individual's lifespan is represented by a range - starting from their birth year (inclusive) to the year they die (exclusive). To find the year with the maximum population, we need to count the number of individuals alive in each year across all given records.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Representation**: We can use two arrays (or a "sweep line" technique) to store the population changes over the years as people are born and die.
   - An array `birth_effect` will track the population increase for every birth.
   - An array `death_effect` will track the population decrease for every year after a person dies.

2. **Population Change Calculation**:
   - Loop through each individual's birth and death years.
   - For each birth year, increment the respective index in `birth_effect`.
   - For each death year, decrement the index in `death_effect`.

3. **Calculate Population Over Time**:
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current population.
   - Iterate through the years (from the minimum birth year to the maximum year needed).
   - Adjust the current population by adding the values from `birth_effect` and subtracting from `death_effect`.

4. **Track the Maximum**:
   - While iterating, track the year when the population reaches its peak count.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of individuals. We are doing a single pass through the data for processing.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). Since we are only using a fixed range for population tracking (years 1950 to 2050), it does not depend on input size.

            populationChange[log[0]]++;  // Birth year
            populationChange[log[1]]--;  // Death year
        }
        
        int maxPopulation = 0, yearWithMaxPopulation = 1950, currentPopulation = 0;
        for (int year = 1950; year <= 2050; ++year) {
            currentPopulation += populationChange[year];
            if (currentPopulation > maxPopulation) {
                maxPopulation = currentPopulation;
                yearWithMaxPopulation = year;
            }
        }
        
        return yearWithMaxPopulation;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<int>> logs = {{1993, 1999}, {2000, 2010}, {1995, 2005}};
    int result = solution.maximumPopulation(logs);
    cout << "Maximum Population Year: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
