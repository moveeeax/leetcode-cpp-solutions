# **[Car Pooling](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine whether it is possible to transport all passengers to their respective destinations without exceeding the capacity of the car at any point in time. Each ride is represented by a start location and an end location, as well as the number of passengers that need to be picked up and dropped off. The solution needs to ensure that the total number of passengers in the car never exceeds the specified capacity.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle this problem, we can use a technique called the "sweep line" or "timeline" method. We will keep track of events occurring at specific points (the start and the end of each ride) using a timeline approach where we can adjust the number of passengers based on the rides. 

1. **Event Creation**: For every trip, we create two events: 
   - When passengers are picked up (increment) at the start location.
   - When passengers are dropped off (decrement) at the end location.
   
2. **Sorting Events**: We sort these events by location. In case of ties (i.e., multiple events at the same location), we will prioritize drop-offs before pickups to ensure that we aren't counting excess passengers already in the car.

3. **Processing Events**: We iterate through these sorted events, maintaining a current count of passengers in the car. At each event, we either add or drop the specified number of passengers and check if the count exceeds the capacity.

4. **Return the Result**: If at any point the count of passengers exceeds the capacity, we return false, otherwise true if we process all events without exceeding it.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of trips. This is due to sorting the events.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the events.

```cpp
class CarPooling {
public:
    bool carPool(int capacity, vector<vector<int>>& trips) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> events; // Using pair to hold (position, change in passengers)

        // Creating the events
        for (const auto& trip : trips) {
            int numPassengers = trip[0];
            int startLocation = trip[1];
            int endLocation = trip[2];
            
            events.emplace_back(startLocation, numPassengers); // Picking up passengers
            events.emplace_back(endLocation, -numPassengers); // Dropping off passengers
        }

        // Sorting events: first by position, then by passenger change
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());

        int currentPassengers = 0;

        // Processing the events
        for (const auto& event : events) {
            currentPassengers += event.second;
            if (currentPassengers > capacity) {
                return false;  // Exceeded capacity
            }
        }
        
        return true; // All passengers can be transported without exceeding capacity
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `car_pooling.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `CarPooling` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
