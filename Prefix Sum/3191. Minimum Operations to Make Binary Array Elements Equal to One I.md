# **[Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform a binary array into an array of all ones (`1`). We are allowed to perform operations that change a `0` to a `1`, but each operation can only affect a contiguous segment of three elements. This means that if we want to change an element at index `i`, we can only affect the elements at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. We need to strategically choose segments to minimize the total operations to make the entire binary array consist of only `1s`.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Traverse the array while checking for segments of `0s`.
2. Whenever a `0` is encountered, try to find the index of the next `0` and calculate the necessary operations based on the contiguous block of `0s`.
3. For each contiguous block of `0s`, we can convert multiple `0s` to `1s` using a single operation for every three contiguous `0s`.
4. Sum the total operations needed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the array in a single pass.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We use a constant amount of space for variables.

                operations++;
                i += 2; // Jump over the next two elements, since they will also be flipped to 1
            }
        }
