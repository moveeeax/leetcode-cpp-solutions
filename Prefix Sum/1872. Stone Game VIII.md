# **[Stone Game VIII](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-viii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we have a game involving a list of integers that represent stones arranged in a line. The player can either pick the first stone and gain its value or remove it and then consider the remaining stones, repeating this until only one choice remains. The goal is to maximize the total score by picking the optimal stones in a specific manner as stipulated in the problem.

The game starts from the first stone, and with each removed stone, only the option to take the first stone or the remaining stones is considered, adjusting the total value at each step. Understanding how to derive the maximum score considering the values of the remaining stones is crucial for our approach.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Pre-computation**: First, compute the prefix sums of the `stones` array. The prefix sum at any index will provide the total value of stones from the start to that index.
  
2. **Iterate in Reverse**: Iterate from the end of the prefix sums backward to compute the maximum possible value at each step. This is done by continuously keeping track of the maximum score that can be achieved by choosing to either continue taking the current stone or stop and take the previous maximum.

3. **Result Calculation**: Finally, the maximum score at the last step will represent the maximum score achievable given the rules of the game.

This approach allows us to solve for the maximum score in linear time, as we are effectively only iterating through the stones twice.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), since we iterate through the `stones` array at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few auxiliary variables for storing the results.

        }
        
        // Start with the maximum score equal to the total value of all stones
        int maxScore = prefixSum[n - 1]; 
        // Traverse from the second last stone to the first one
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
            maxScore = max(maxScore, prefixSum[i]);
            prefixSum[i] = maxScore;
        }
        
        // Final result would be the maximum of the first stone or the computed max
        return maxScore;
