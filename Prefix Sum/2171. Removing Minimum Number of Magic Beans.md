# **[Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans](https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-minimum-number-of-magic-beans/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to minimize the total number of magic beans remaining after potentially removing some beans from a collection of beans, each represented by their respective quantities. The removal cost is equivalent to the number of beans we remove, and the goal is to make the remaining beans as few as possible, while prioritizing a constraint on how many beans can be taken away based on the basic rule of magic beans.

To do this efficiently, we need to focus on the distribution of beans. By removing beans from those with the most quantity, we can effectively minimize the remaining sum of beans, as removing larger quantities first would yield a lower sum of remaining beans for the given set.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Bean Quantities**: Start by sorting the input list of bean quantities. This allows us to systematically deal with the largest quantities first.
2. **Calculate Total Beans and Initialization**: Calculate the sum of all beans to keep track of how many beans we are starting with.
3. **Iterate Through Sorted Beans**: Create a loop to iterate through each bean quantity:
   - For each quantity, calculate the total remaining beans after removing the current and all larger quantities.
   - Compute the current cost and track the minimum remaining quantity encountered.
4. **Return the Result**: At the end, return the minimum remaining beans across all iterations.

This strategy allows for an efficient way to assess how many beans can be effectively removed given our constraints.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using constant additional space for calculations (excluding input storage).

            // Remaining beans if we remove all beans from index i to n-1
            int remainingBeans = totalBeans - (n - i) * beans[i];
            minRemaining = min(minRemaining, remainingBeans);
