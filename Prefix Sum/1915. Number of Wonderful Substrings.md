# **[Number of Wonderful Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-wonderful-substrings/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about finding "wonderful substrings" in a given string where a substring is considered wonderful if it contains at most one character with an odd frequency. This means we can have any combination of characters, but only one character can appear an odd number of times. For instance, the substring "aaabb" is wonderful because it has two characters 'a' and 'b' with frequencies 3 and 2 respectively - here 'a' appears an odd number of times and 'b' does not. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle the problem, we can utilize the concept of character parity (odd/even counts) and maintain a count of these states using bitmasking:

1. **Bitmask Representation**: 
    - We represent the frequency of characters using a bitmask. Each bit in a 10-bit integer represents whether a character ('a' to 'j') has an odd (1) or even (0) frequency.
    - For example, if 'a' is odd and the others are even, our bitmask would look like `0000000001`.

2. **Count of States**: 
    - We will maintain a count of the occurrences of each bitmask as we traverse the string. For any substring ending at a character, we check how many times we have seen this bitmask before and add that to our result.
    - Additionally, we can flip each bit in the bitmask (representing flipping the parity of the corresponding characters) and check for how many substrings have had that state before. This will allow us to count substrings where one character is allowed to be in an odd count.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) ‚Äî We traverse the string once and perform a constant amount of work for each character due to bit manipulation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) ‚Äî We only use a fixed size array for the counts of bitmask states.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long wonderfulSubstrings(string word) {
        long long result = 0;
        int count[1024] = {0}; // 0 to 1023 for 2^10 states
        count[0] = 1; // Empty substring case

        int mask = 0; // This will represent odd/even counts of letters a-j

        for (char c : word) {
            mask ^= (1 << (c - 'a')); // Flip the bit for the character
            result += count[mask]; // Same bitmask seen before

            // Check all possibilities with one character allowed to be odd
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                result += count[mask ^ (1 << i)]; // Flip ith character's bit
            }

            count[mask]++; // Increment the count for this bitmask
        }

        return result; // Total number of wonderful substrings
    }
