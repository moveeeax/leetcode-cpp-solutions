# **[Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves selecting an index from an array based on the weights provided for each value. Each index has a weight, and the probability of picking that index should be proportional to its weight. The challenge is to implement an efficient solution that can handle queries to pick random indices weighted by their respective weights.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem effectively, we can use a prefix sum array to represent weights cumulatively. This allows us to define ranges for each index based on their weights. The steps can be broken down as follows:
1. **Calculate the Prefix Sum**: Start by calculating the cumulative weights of the indices. This helps in determining the range for random selection.
2. **Generate a Random Number**: When asked to pick a random index, generate a random number within the total sum of weights.
3. **Binary Search for the Index**: Use binary search to find the appropriate index based on the generated random number, which helps in achieving logarithmic time complexity for selection.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for the initial setup to create the prefix sum array, and O(log n) for each pick.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the prefix sum.
