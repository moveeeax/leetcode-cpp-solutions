# **[Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-partitions-with-even-sum-difference/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around counting the distinct ways to partition an array into two subsets such that the absolute difference of their sums is even. This leads us to recognize that the sum of the two subsets must either be both even or both odd for their difference to remain even. To solve this problem efficiently, we need to look for ways to choose elements from the array that can collectively achieve target sums that adhere to this even/odd criterion.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding the Condition**: Sum(P1) - Sum(P2) = even implies that both sums must be either even or odd.
   
2. **Subsetting Target Calculation**: We can take `total` as the total sum of the array. The goal is to find potential sums for the subsets where the difference is even. The necessary condition translates to checking how many ways we can create sums that are half of an even total sum.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Setup**:
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[s]` will represent the number of ways to form a subset with sum `s`.
   - Initialize with `dp[0] = 1` (one way to create a sum of zero).

4. **Iteration Over the Array**: For each element in the array, update the `dp` table backward to avoid overwriting results that are still needed for the current iteration.

5. **Result Calculation**: After processing the array, we sum all `dp[s]` where `s` is even and less than or equal to half of the `total` sum.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * total/2), where n is the number of elements in the array and total is the sum of all elements, considering we might need to iterate over possible subset sums.
- **Space Complexity**: O(total/2), due to the dp array.
