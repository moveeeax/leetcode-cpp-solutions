# **[Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions](https://leetcode.com/problems/change-minimum-characters-to-satisfy-one-of-three-conditions/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is to change characters in two strings such that one of three conditions is satisfied ‚Äî they can either become the same string, the first string can have all characters greater than the second string, or the first string can have all characters less than the second string. The goal is to achieve this with the minimal number of changes to the characters in the strings.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We will determine the number of changes required for all three conditions:
1. Transforming both strings to be the same.
2. Making all characters in `word1` greater than those in `word2`.
3. Making all characters in `word1` less than those in `word2`.

For the first condition, we will count how many characters differ at the same positions in the two strings which gives a direct count of changes needed to make them identical.

For the second and third conditions, we can calculate the cost of changing each individual's characters to the minimum or maximum character needed from the other string to satisfy the order.

We will iterate through both strings considering their ASCII values, calculating the changes required for each of the three conditions and return the minimum changes needed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the strings (both are equal in length).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a fixed number of additional variables for counting.

        int countA[26] = {0}, countB[26] = {0};
        int lenA = a.size(), lenB = b.size();
        
        // Count characters in both strings
        for (char c : a) countA[c - 'a']++;
        for (char c : b) countB[c - 'a']++;
        
        // Case 1: Change both strings to be the same
        int minChanges = lenA + lenB; // Max changes are changing all characters
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            minChanges = min(minChanges, lenA - countA[i] + lenB - countB[i]);
        }
        
        // Case 2: Change word1 to be greater than word2
        int totalB = lenB; 
        for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) { // only need to consider 0 to 24
            totalB -= countB[i]; // characters in word2
            minChanges = min(minChanges, lenA - countA[i + 1] + totalB);
        }
        
        // Case 3: Change word1 to be less than word2
        int totalA = lenA; 
        for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) { // only need to consider 0 to 24
            totalA -= countA[i]; // characters in word1
            minChanges = min(minChanges, totalA + lenB - countB[i + 1]);

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `solution.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
