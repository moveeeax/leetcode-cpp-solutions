# **[Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-of-an-element-after-performing-operations-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum frequency of any integer in a given array `nums` after performing a series of operations defined as incrementing any element by `1` any number of times. Each operation increases the value of a specific integer, and by doing so, we can potentially increase the frequency of that integer within the array. 

To solve this problem, we need a method to track how many times we can perform these operations efficiently, while ensuring that we maximize the frequency of any single integer. The goal is to make as many numbers equal as possible by performing the least amount of operations.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting**: Begin by sorting the `nums` array. Sorting will allow us to easily manage ranges of numbers and increment them in linear fashion since all numbers can only be increased.
  
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum frequency:
   - Use one pointer (`left`) to track the beginning of a range of numbers and the other pointer (`right`) to expand this range.
   - For every new number added (by moving the `right` pointer), evaluate the total cost of converting all numbers in the range defined by `left` to `right` to the value of `nums[right]`.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost to convert all numbers from `nums[left]` to `nums[right]` to `nums[right]` can be calculated using the formula:
   - Cost = `nums[right] * (right - left + 1) - prefix_sum` where `prefix_sum` is the cumulative sum of the numbers from index `left` to `right`.

4. **Updating Frequencies**: If the calculated cost exceeds `k` (the number of operations we can perform), increment the `left` pointer to shrink the range, and recalculate.

5. **Max Frequency**: Keep track of the maximum number of elements that can be equal in this process and update it whenever we find a valid range.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step; the two-pointer iteration is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space.
