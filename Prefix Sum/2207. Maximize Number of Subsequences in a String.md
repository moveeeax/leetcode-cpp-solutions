# **[Maximize Number of Subsequences in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-number-of-subsequences-in-a-string/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to maximize the number of subsequences in a string formed by a specific pattern, composed of the characters 'a' and 'b'. A valid subsequence must start with the character 'a' and end with the character 'b'. Thus, for every 'a' in the string, we try to find how many 'b's come after it, giving rise to various combinations of valid subsequences.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Counts**: We need to first count the total number of 'a's and 'b's in the string.
2. **Calculate Prefix Sum**: Create an array that accumulates the count of 'a's from the beginning to any position in the string. This helps to quickly compute how many 'a's are available before a given index.
3. **Compute Valid Subsequences**: For each 'b' encountered in the string, the number of valid subsequences ending with that 'b' can be determined by the count of 'a's seen before it. This means for each 'b', we can sum the possible combinations of 'a's.
4. **Adjusting for Empty Subsequence**: Initialize the result with the empty subsequence as a valid subsequence before summing.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) since we traverse the string a couple of times (once for counting and once for summing).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for counting characters without any additional data structures.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumSubsequenceCount(string text, string pattern) {
        long long aCount = 0, bCount = 0, result = 0;

        // Count total 'a's and 'b's in the string
        for (char ch : text) {
            if (ch == 'a') aCount++;
            else if (ch == 'b') bCount++;
        }

        // If pattern is "ab", for every 'b', we can form pairs with 'a's before it.
        // The result will be the sum of pairs plus the total 'a's and a single empty subsequence.
        result = aCount * bCount + aCount;

        return result;
    }
};  
```

        for (char ch : text) {
            if (ch == 'a') aCount++;
            else if (ch == 'b') bCount++;
        }

        // If pattern is "ab", for every 'b', we can form pairs with 'a's before it.
        // The result will be the sum of pairs plus the total 'a's and a single empty subsequence.
        result = aCount * bCount + aCount;

        return result;
    }

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::string text = "abbaba"; // Example input
    std::string pattern = "ab"; // The pattern to maximize
    long long result = sol.maximumSubsequenceCount(text, pattern);
    std::cout << result << std::endl; // Output the result
    return 0;
