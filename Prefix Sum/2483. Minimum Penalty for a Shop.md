# **[Minimum Penalty for a Shop](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-penalty-for-a-shop/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about calculating the minimum penalty for a shop based on its open and close days. We have a string representing the schedule of a shop, where 'Y' indicates that the shop is open on a day, and 'N' indicates that it is closed. The penalty for a shop that is closed on more than one consecutive day is considered to be high, and we want to find out the day with the least penalty in terms of the store's schedule.

We want to return the earliest day in which the penalty is minimal. If the shop is open on the given day, the penalty is 0. If it is closed, the penalty is determined by the number of consecutive closed days after that day, plus one additional penalty for that day marked as 'N'.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Initialize two counters: one for counting the penalties at the current position and another for the minimum penalty found.
2. Loop through the given string to evaluate each character:
   - If the character is 'Y': The penalty is reset since the shop is open.
   - If the character is 'N': Increment the current penalty along with a subsequent check for future 'N's.
3. Record the earliest position of the minimal penalty as we traverse through the entire string.
4. Return the earliest position as the answer.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We traverse the string just once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of additional space for variables.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bestClosingTime(string customers) {
        int penalty = 0;
        int minPenalty = INT_MAX;
        int bestTime = customers.size(); // Default to the end after all days

        for (int time = 0; time < customers.size(); ++time) {
            if (customers[time] == 'N') {
                penalty++; // Increment penalty for 'N'
            }

            if (penalty < minPenalty) {
                minPenalty = penalty;
                bestTime = time + 1; // Store the best time (1-indexed)
            }
        }

        // After the loop, consider the penalty if no further 'Y' is found
        return bestTime; // if customers are all 'Y', best time is end of the string
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `minimum_penalty.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int bestClosingTime(string customers) {
        int penalty = 0;
        int minPenalty = INT_MAX;
        int bestTime = customers.size(); // Default to the end after all days

        for (int time = 0; time < customers.size(); ++time) {
            if (customers[time] == 'N') {
                penalty++; // Increment penalty for 'N'
            }

            if (penalty < minPenalty) {
                minPenalty = penalty;
                bestTime = time + 1; // Store the best time (1-indexed)
            }
        }

        return bestTime; // if customers are all 'Y', best time is end of the string
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string customers;
    
    cout << "Enter the shop schedule (string of Y and N): ";
    cin >> customers;
    
    int result = sol.bestClosingTime(customers);
    cout << "Best closing time (1-indexed): " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
