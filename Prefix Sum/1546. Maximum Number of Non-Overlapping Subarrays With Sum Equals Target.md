# **[Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-subarrays-with-sum-equals-target/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of non-overlapping subarrays that sum to a given target. Essentially, we need to traverse the array and identify distinct sections that, when summed, equal the target. Overlapping sections should not be counted, which complicates the problem as we cannot just count all subarrays that equal the target; we need to ensure they do not share common elements.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this, we can use a hash map to store cumulative sums as we traverse the array. This will allow us to efficiently track when we reach the target sum. The key steps in our approach are:
1. Initialize a hash map to keep track of cumulative sums and their most recent positions.
2. As we iterate through the array, calculate the cumulative sum.
3. Check if the cumulative sum minus the target exists in our hash map. If it does, it indicates that from the start of the subarray (after the found sum) to the current index sums to the target.
4. If a valid subarray is found, we reset the start position for our next potential non-overlapping subarray.
5. Count how many such subarrays we can form without overlaps.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the array once, performing constant-time operations for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - We use a hash map to store cumulative sums, which in the worst case can grow linearly with the number of elements in the input array.

            currSum += nums[i];
            if (sumMap.find(currSum - target) != sumMap.end()) {
                // check if the found index is after the last found non-overlapping subarray
                if (sumMap[currSum - target] >= lastEnd) {
                    count++; // we found a new valid subarray
                    lastEnd = i; // update the lastEnd to current index
                }
