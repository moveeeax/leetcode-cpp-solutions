# **[Find the K-th Character in String Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves generating a sequence of strings dynamically through an iterative doubling mechanism, where each round of operations doubles the previously generated string and modifies it by adding specific substrings based on certain rules. The goal is to find the k-th character in the infinitely generated string after those operations.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding the Structure**: Each round results in the current string being doubled. For example, if after the first round we have "a", the next round we would have "aa", forming:
   - Round 1: "a"  
   - Round 2: "aa"  
   - Round 3: "aaaa"  
   - Round 4: "aaaaaaaa"  
   - ...  

2. **Finding the Length**: Keep track of the length of the current structure that simulates the infinite generation of the string without actually constructing it.

3. **Calculating the K-th Character**: Since constructing the full string for large k would be infeasible, we simulate the process. For each query to find the k-th character:
   - Reduce k by halves based on the current structure of the built string by checking if k falls in the first part or the new modifications until reaching a base case.

4. **Base Case**: When we reduce the k to a point where we have a single character (original) and output that character.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(k)), as for each step we keep halving k based on the length of the constructed string.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since no additional data structures proportional to input size are used.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findKthCharacter(int n, int k) {
        long length = 1; // length starts from the initial character "a"

        // Calculate length of the string after n rounds
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            length *= 2; // The length doubles each round
        }

        // Find the k-th character
        while (n > 0) {
            long halfLength = length / 2; // Calculate half of the current length
            
            if (k > halfLength) { 
                // If k is in the second half, adjust k and reduce n
                k -= halfLength; // Move k to the corresponding index in the second half
            }

            // In either case, we are effectively reducing our problem size
            length = halfLength; // Now the effective length is half of before
            n--; // One round less to consider
        }

        return 'a'; // The base case, first character
    }
};
