# **[Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The Fibonacci sequence is a well-known sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The challenge requires us to find the nth Fibonacci number efficiently without resorting to simple recursion, which would have an exponential time complexity and lead to excessive function calls.

To summarize, the Fibonacci sequence starts:  
- F(0) = 0  
- F(1) = 1  
- F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1  
- F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2  
- F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3  
- F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 5  
And so forth. The goal is to compute the nth number in this sequence efficiently.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To compute the nth Fibonacci number efficiently, we can use an iterative approach. This is preferred over the recursive approach because it significantly reduces the overhead of function calls and it can be done in linear time while only using constant space.

1. **Initialization**: Begin with defined Fibonacci numbers for F(0) and F(1) which are 0 and 1 respectively.
2. **Iteration**: For each number from 2 up to n, compute the next Fibonacci number by summing the two preceding numbers.
3. **Memory Efficiency**: We can store only the last two Fibonacci numbers instead of the entire sequence, making our space complexity O(1).
4. **Return Result**: At the end of the loop, the nth Fibonacci number is stored in the relevant variable.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) ‚Äì We iterate through the loop n times.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) ‚Äì We only use a constant amount of space for variables.
