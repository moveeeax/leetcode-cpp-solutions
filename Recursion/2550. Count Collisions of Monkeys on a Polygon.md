# **[Count Collisions of Monkeys on a Polygon](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-collisions-of-monkeys-on-a-polygon/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a polygon with monkeys aligned at its vertices, each moving in a specific direction: clockwise ("R"), counterclockwise ("L"), or staying still ("S"). The goal is to determine how many collisions will occur as these monkeys move along the edges of the polygon. A collision happens when two or more monkeys end up on the same vertex as they traverse the polygon. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Moving Directions**: Evaluate the directions of the monkeys from the start of the list to the end.
   - If we encounter the "L" (moving left) after "R" (moving right) in the string, then every "R" will collide with this "L". 
   - If we see "R" followed by "S" or if "S" is followed by "L", we need to assess the collisions accordingly.
   
2. **Count Collisions**: Iterate through the list of monkeys:
   - Count the total number of "R" and "L" in the order they appear. For each "R", if it's followed by "L", it will directly contribute to the collision count.
   - "S" can participate in collisions with both "R" and "L".

3. **Summary of Counts**: Keep a running total of all collision counts from each transition among monkey states as we iterate through the string.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string because we are making a single pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space for counting.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `count_collisions.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
