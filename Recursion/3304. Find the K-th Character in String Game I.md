# **[Find the K-th Character in String Game I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves building a sequence of strings based on an initial character and certain expansion rules. The string expands repeatedly, following a pattern where each iteration consists of concatenation of the previous string followed by 'a', then the previous string again followed by 'b'. The primary task is to identify the k-th character of the resultant string after several expansions without explicitly constructing the entire string, particularly since it can grow exponentially.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understand the string expansion:** The initial string `s = "a"` becomes:
   - Iteration 1: "a"
   - Iteration 2: "aab" (the first iteration followed by 'a', concatenated with the first iteration followed by 'b')
   - Iteration 3: "aabaab" (the second iteration followed by 'a', concatenated with the second iteration followed by 'b')
   This rapidly doubles the size of the string at each iteration.

2. **Calculate lengths:** Instead of constructing strings, calculate their lengths. Observing that each iteration doubles its size allows us to infer the position of k in the resultant string.

3. **Use recursion (or iteration):** To find the k-th character, we can use a while loop (or recursion) that reduces 'k' based on the identified transformative structure of string splitting, adjusting k as we locate which part of the string it belongs to.

4. **Determine character:** When k falls into the part of the string that consists of the previous iteration plus an additional 'a' or 'b', we can directly calculate from there.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log k) due to the way we can halve the value of k repeatedly without needing to generate whole strings.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we use only a few variables for calculations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findKthCharacter(int k) {
        int length = 1; // initial length for "a"
        while (length < k) {
            length = length * 2 + 1; // size of s_n = 2 * length(s_(n-1)) + 1
        }
        
        while (k > 1) {
            int prevLength = (length - 1) / 2; // half of the size of the previous string
            if (k == prevLength + 1) {
                return 'a'; // k is at the position of 'a'
            } 
            if (k > prevLength + 1) {
                k -= (prevLength + 1); // skip the first half of the string
            }
            length = prevLength; // continue with the previous string's length
        }
        
        return 'a'; // base case when k = 1
    }
};

            }
            length = prevLength; // continue with the previous string's length
        }
