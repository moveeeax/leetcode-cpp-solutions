# **[Elimination Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to simulate a process of elimination among `n` participants, standing in a circle and being eliminated in rounds based on their positions. In each round, participants standing in the odd positions are eliminated until only one remains. The challenge is to determine the position of this last remaining participant without simulating the entire elimination process, as it could be computationally expensive for large values of `n`.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We can use mathematical reasoning to efficiently determine the final position without iterating through every single elimination. Here‚Äôs the simplified reasoning:

1. **Binary Representation**: The problem can be rephrased through the binary representation of numbers. The first participant to be eliminated is always at an odd index in each iteration; thus, we can visualize this elimination through powers of 2. 

2. **Iteratively Narrowing Down**: After each complete elimination round where all odd-numbered participants are removed, the process can be observed as resetting the problem with `n` halved (either rounded up or down depending on whether `n` is odd or even). 

3. **Final Position Formula**: The final remaining position can be calculated based on a pattern formed by working with power of 2. Specifically, when the number of participants reduces, the last remaining position can be computed as follows:
   - Identify the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
   - The position can be expressed mathematically, so we reduce our problem progressively until only one participant remains.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) ‚Äì The algorithm reduces the size of the problem each time by considering powers of 2.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) ‚Äì Only a constant amount of space is used for variables, independent of the input size.
