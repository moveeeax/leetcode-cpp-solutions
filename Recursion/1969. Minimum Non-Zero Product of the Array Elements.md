# **[Minimum Non-Zero Product of the Array Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-non-zero-product-of-the-array-elements/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to compute the minimum non-zero product of an array derived from integers based on the given input `p`. The integer `p` represents the highest number in an array consisting of elements from `1` to `p`. We need to multiply these numbers together while ensuring that we do not include any zeros in the product. Given that `p` can be up to `10^9`, straightforward computation of the full product would result in very large numbers, which cannot be handled directly.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can realize that the product of numbers from `1` to `p` can be incredibly large and unnecessary to compute directly. Instead, we focus on a few crucial points:

1. **Product Modulo**: As the result can be extremely large, we should compute the product modulo `10^9 + 7` (as is common in competitive programming to prevent overflow).

2. **Final Product**: The product of the sequence can be represented as all numbers from `1` to `p`, but since we can also exclude the largest number `p` (when `p % 2 == 0`), we can use properties of powers to reduce computations.

3. **Use of Exponents**: The result for even `p` can be derived from `(p-1)! * ((p-1)/2)`. For odd `p`, the last number, `p`, is included in the product. 

The goal can thus be broken down to avoiding the computation of the full product and instead calculating the contributions based on the structure of the numbers.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log p) due to exponentiation by squaring.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a few variables to keep track of the result.
