# **[Power of Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine if a given integer `n` is a power of three. A number is a power of three if it can be expressed in the form \(3^k\), where \(k\) is a non-negative integer. For example, 1, 3, 9, and 27 are all powers of three.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To determine if `n` is a power of three, we can continuously divide `n` by 3 as long as `n` is greater than 1. If we end up with 1, then `n` was a power of three. If at any point `n` is not divisible by 3 before reaching 1, then it's not a power of three.

1. **Check for negativity**: If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return `false` immediately since negative numbers and zero cannot be powers of three.
2. **Iterate**: While `n` is greater than 1, if `n` is divisible by 3, divide it by 3; otherwise, return `false`.
3. **Return result**: If we exit the loop and `n` equals 1, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) since we are dividing `n` by 3 in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space.
