# **[Modify Graph Edge Weights](https://leetcode.com/problems/modify-graph-edge-weights/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to adjust the weights of the edges in a directed graph such that the sum of the weights is maximized while still satisfying the condition that weights remain positive. The total number of directed edges and their weights are given, and we must ensure we modify these weights in a way that adheres to this stipulation.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use an understanding of the relationship between the weights of edges directed from node `u` to `v` and the requirement that when we make edges `(u, v)` and `(v, u)`, the smallest edge weight should be re-evaluated if the maximum total weight can be preserved. 

The essential steps would be:
1. **Identify the edges**: We will read the edges and understand their initial lengths.
2. **Modify weights**: We need to ensure that upon making pairs of connections, at least one direction must maintain a weight that does not cause the total calculation of weights to fall below what it originally was.
3. **Compute the final weight values**: Calculate the modified values needed at all times based on interactions of weights from each directed edge to the directed neighbor.

The primary objective is to derive the necessary conditions to retain maximum weight while ensuring no weights drop below zero during modification.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of edges since we traverse the edges to compute results.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only require a constant amount of additional space for tracking weights and values.
