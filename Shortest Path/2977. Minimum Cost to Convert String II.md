# **[Minimum Cost to Convert String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-convert-string-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to convert two strings, `s1` and `s2`, into one another by only substituting characters. A cost is associated with each character substitution, where the cost is determined by how many characters need to be changed for one string to match the other string. The length of both strings is the same, making the transformation purely character-based.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
1. **Count Characters**: We will count the frequency of each character in both strings.
2. **Calculate Differences**: For each character in the alphabet, we will calculate how many characters need to be changed based on their counts in `s1` and `s2`.
3. **Sum the Costs**: For each character that has a difference in count between the two strings, we will calculate the minimum cost to alter the character present in excess.

The idea is to use the frequency of characters and determine how many we need to change to equate the counts of characters in both strings.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the strings, since we are iterating through the characters a constant number of times (26 for alphabet characters).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because the space for frequency counts is fixed at 26 irrespective of input size.

        }

        // Calculate the cost of converting s1 into s2
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (count1[i] > count2[i]) {
                cost += count1[i] - count2[i];
            }
        }
