# **[Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires finding a path in a directed graph that maximizes the product of the probabilities of traveling along edges between the start and the end node. Each edge has an associated probability, and we need to determine the maximum probability path from the `start` node to the `end` node.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can model it as a graph traversal problem. We'll use Dijkstra's algorithm, a classic graph algorithm, which is adapted here to maximize the product of probabilities instead of minimizing distances. 

1. **Graph Representation**: We will use an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each graph edge connects two nodes with a given probability.
2. **Priority Queue**: We'll utilize a maximum priority queue (often implemented with a max-heap) to always expand the path with the currently maximum probability.
3. **Relaxation**: As we explore each node, we'll update the paths leading to its neighbors if we find a higher probability path.
4. **Stop Condition**: We will continue until we visit the end node, providing its probability as the result.

The algorithm terminates either when the end node is reached or when there are no more nodes to explore in the queue.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) * log V) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, due to using a priority queue.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for storing the graph and O(V) for the priority queue.
