# **[Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to identify a city that has the fewest neighbors (cities directly connected to it via routes) within a specified distance, known as the threshold distance. We‚Äôll represent cities and routes using a graph approach, where cities are nodes and routes are edges with weights indicating the distance between two cities.

To solve this problem, we need to efficiently find cities that satisfy the threshold condition, which suggests a shortest-path algorithm will be useful since the routes can have different lengths.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and the distances between them using an adjacency list.
2. **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**: For each city, use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths to all other cities. This will allow us to collect data on neighbors within the specified threshold distance.
3. **Neighbor Counting**: Count how many cities are reachable from each city within the given threshold distance based on the results from Dijkstra's.
4. **Result Determination**: Track the city with the smallest neighbor count, resolving ties using the city index (smallest index).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(V^2 + E log V) where V is the number of cities and E is the number of edges, due to Dijkstra's algorithm being called for each city.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for storing the graph and O(V) for distance tracking in Dijkstra's.
