# **[Find Minimum Time to Reach Last Room I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-reach-last-room-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem states that we need to navigate through a grid-like set of rooms where each room has a time cost associated with it. Our goal is to find the minimum time required to reach the last room starting from the first room. The time to traverse each room may vary based on two parameters: either the desired time to reach the adjacent room or the setup time associated with moving through a specific room. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we can use a graph traversal technique, preferably Dijkstra's algorithm. The rooms can be seen as nodes in a graph where edges represent the time taken to transition from one room to the adjacent rooms. 

1. **Data Structure**: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently get the room with the minimum time cost during exploration.
2. **Initialization**: Start from the first room (room 0) and initialize its time as 0. For all other rooms, set their initial time to infinity.
3. **Exploration**: Repeatedly extract the room with the minimum accumulated time from the queue. For each adjacent room, calculate the potential new time to reach it and if this time is less than the previously recorded time, update it and push the new state (room index, updated time) into the queue.
4. **Termination**: The process continues until all reachable rooms are explored, and specifically, we track the time to reach the last room.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices (rooms).
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for storing the minimum times and the graph structure.
