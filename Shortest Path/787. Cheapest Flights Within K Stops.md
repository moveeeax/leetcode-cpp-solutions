# **[Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the cheapest flight from a source city to a destination city with a maximum of K stops. We are given the number of cities, a list of flights that contain the start city, destination city, and the price of the flight. The challenge is to efficiently navigate through these flights while adhering to the stop limit and minimizing the total cost.

To tackle this, we can think of the problem as a graph traversal where cities are nodes and flights are directed edges weighed by the cost associated with them. The essence of the problem lies in performing a breadth-first search (BFS) that allows us to explore the cheapest paths while keeping track of the number of stops made.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph where each city points to a list of pairs representing its neighboring cities and the costs to reach them.
  
2. **Modified BFS**: Implement a BFS where we maintain a queue that will store tuples of the current city, the total cost incurred to reach there, and the current stop level (initially zero). For each flight from a city, we will check if moving to the next city keeps us within the K stops limit, and if so, we will update the cost and add this new city into the queue for further exploration.

3. **Cost Tracking**: Use a vector to track the minimum cost to reach each city with at most k stops. Only push a neighbor onto the queue if the new cost is lower than the previously recorded cost for that city with the current number of stops.

4. **Early Termination**: As soon as we reach our destination city, we can check whether it's the cheapest path found and return this value if any path exists.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(E + V), where E is the number of edges (flights) and V is the number of cities (nodes), since each edge and node will be processed.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), due to maintaining the cost vector and the queue.
