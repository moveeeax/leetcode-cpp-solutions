# **[Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to maximize the number of points we can obtain from a given list of cards, where we can take cards from the beginning or the end of the list. We can only take a fixed number of cards (indicated by `k`). To solve this problem, we need to evaluate different ways of selecting `k` cards from the two ends and calculate the total points obtained. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We will sum the last `k` cards to get an initial count. 
2. Then we will iteratively shift cards from the end to the front, replacing them with cards from the start of the array. 
3. For each iteration, we will calculate the sum of selected cards and update the maximum points.
4. Finally, return the maximum points obtained.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(k) - We iterate through the array up to `k` times to calculate sums.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - No additional data structures are used that grow with input size.

        for (int i = n - k; i < n; ++i) {
            totalPoints += cardPoints[i];
        }
        
        int maxPoints = totalPoints;

        // Start taking cards from the left and dropping from the right
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            totalPoints = totalPoints - cardPoints[n - 1 - i] + cardPoints[i];
            maxPoints = max(maxPoints, totalPoints);
        }
        
        return maxPoints;
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `maximum_points_from_cards.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `MaximumPointsInCards` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

        // Sum the last k cards
        for (int i = n - k; i < n; ++i) {
            totalPoints += cardPoints[i];
        }
        
        int maxPoints = totalPoints;

        // Start taking cards from the left and dropping from the right
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            totalPoints = totalPoints - cardPoints[n - 1 - i] + cardPoints[i];
            maxPoints = max(maxPoints, totalPoints);
        }
        
        return maxPoints;
    }
