# **[Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of substrings in a given string that contain all three specified characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'. A substring is any continuous sequence of characters within the string, and the challenge is to efficiently track how many of these substrings can be formed.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with a hash map or an array to keep track of the frequency of the required characters within the current window. We can maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `right` expands the window to include more characters and `left` contracts it once we've found a valid substring containing all three characters. 

1. Initialize a frequency array to keep count of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
2. Expand the `right` pointer to include characters, and for each new character, update the frequency array.
3. Once our window contains all three characters (i.e., all counts in the frequency array are greater than 0), increment the `left` pointer to potentially reduce the size of the window while still containing all three characters. 
4. Each time we find a valid window, we count how many substrings end at `right` but begin at any position from `left` to `right`.
5. The number of new valid substrings added is equal to the number of positions from `left` to `right` (which is `right - left + 1`).
6. Continue this until the `right` pointer has traversed the entire string.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), since each character will be processed at most twice (once by `right` and once by `left`).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the frequency array size is constant (fixed size for three characters).

            count[s[right] - 'a']++;
            
            // Check if we have all three characters in the current window
