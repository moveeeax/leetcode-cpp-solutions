# **[Find the Longest Semi-Repetitive Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-longest-semi-repetitive-substring/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
To solve the problem, we need to identify the longest substring of a given string that contains at most one pair of adjacent identical characters. A "semi-repetitive" substring is defined as one which may include at most one occurrence of adjacent duplicates and can consist of other unique characters. The challenge lies in efficiently traversing the string while checking conditions for repetition.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The solution can be thought of as a sliding window problem. We'll maintain two pointers (indices) to denote the current substring we are examining, while also tracking the number of pairs of adjacent duplicate characters. 

1. We'll initialize two pointers: `start` for the beginning of our sliding window and `end` for the current character we're evaluating.
2. As we move the `end` pointer, if we encounter an adjacent duplicate (i.e., `s[end] == s[end-1]`), we will increment a count of such pairs.
3. If this count exceeds 1 (meaning we found more than one adjacent duplicate), we will move the `start` pointer to the right until we restore the condition of at most one pair.
4. We continuously update the length of the longest valid substring encountered during these iterations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string as we only make a single pass through it.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.
