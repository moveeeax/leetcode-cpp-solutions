# **[Subarray Product Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the number of contiguous subarrays in a given integer array where the product of the elements in each subarray is less than a specified integer `k`. A subarray is defined as a contiguous part of an array, which can be single elements or longer segments of the array. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We can solve this problem using the two-pointer or sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window defined by two pointers, `left` and `right`, while calculating the product of the elements within this window. As we expand the right pointer to include elements into the product, we'll check if the product remains less than `k`. If it does, every subarray ending with the current `right` element (from `left` to `right`) is valid, and we can count the number of such subarrays. If at any point the product exceeds or equals `k`, we will increment the left pointer to reduce the size of the window until the product is less than `k` again. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by `right` and once by `left`).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables to hold the product and counts without requiring additional data structures proportional to the input size.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if (k <= 1) return 0; // If k is less than or equal to 1, there can be no valid subarray
        
        int count = 0, product = 1, left = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); ++right) {
            product *= nums[right]; // Expand the window to the right
            
            // Contract the window from the left until the product is less than k
            while (product >= k) {
                product /= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            
            // Count the number of valid subarrays ending with right
            count += right - left + 1;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
