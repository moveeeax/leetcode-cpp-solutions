# **[Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-for-longest-repeated-character-substring/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the maximum length of a substring consisting of repeating characters in a given string by performing at most one swap between two characters. The key idea is to identify the most frequently occurring character since we can potentially create the longest substring of that character by swapping other characters into their place. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Character Frequencies**: First, we will count the frequency of each character in the string using an array (or a hashmap). This allows us to determine which character is the most frequent.
  
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window to traverse the string while attempting to maintain a substring of the most frequent character. We can use two pointers to manage this window.

3. **Consider Swaps**: As we adjust our window, we count the number of characters that are different from our chosen most frequent character. If this count exceeds one, it indicates that we need to swap a character in order to maintain a valid substring of potential long repeated characters.

4. **Max Length Calculation**: The length of the longest substring we can form by considering swaps will be the maximum frequency of the chosen character plus at most one (if a swap is performed).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we are making a single pass through the string for counting and then another pass for the sliding window.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the frequency array has a fixed size for the alphabet (26 letters).
