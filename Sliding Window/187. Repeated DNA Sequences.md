# **[Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves identifying all sequences of DNA that are repeated within a longer DNA string. Each sequence consists of 10 characters made up of the letters A, C, G, and T. We aim to find all unique sequences of 10 nucleotides that appear more than once in the given DNA string.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To efficiently find the repeated sequences, we will utilize a sliding window technique coupled with a hashing strategy. The steps are as follows:

1. **Set for Tracking**: Utilize a `set` to keep track of sequences that have already been observed and another `set` to keep track of repeated sequences.
2. **Sliding Window**: Iterate through the string from the start and extract substrings of length 10. As we move through the DNA string, we will check if each substring is already in our first set of observed sequences:
   - If it is, it suggests that we have found a repeated sequence, which we then add to our second set of repeated sequences.
   - If it is not in the first set, we add it to the first set.
3. **Output**: Finally, we convert the set of repeated sequences into a vector and return it.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the DNA string. We are making a single pass through the string and performing O(1) operations (inserting and checking sets) at each character.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, as we may store all 10-character long sequences in our sets.
