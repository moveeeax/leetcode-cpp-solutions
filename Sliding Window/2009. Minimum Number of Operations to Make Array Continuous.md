# **[Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-continuous/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining the minimum number of operations required to transform an array of integers into a continuous range of values. A continuous range is defined as a sequence of integers where for a given integer `x`, the sequence includes `x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+k` for some integer `k`.  
Given an array, we want to find an optimal starting point within the range defined by the minimum and maximum of the array that would allow us to cover as many values as possible with the least number of modifications. The number of operations would be the number of elements that have to be changed when trying to fit into this continuous range.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting allows us to understand the range of numbers in the array and makes it easier to find potential continuous segments.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use a sliding window (or two pointers) to find the longest segment of the sorted array that can fit within a range of `k` consecutive integers, where `k` is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum of the complete continuous range.
3. **Calculate Operations**: The number of operations required will be the total number of elements minus the count of elements that can be part of the selected continuous range.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the array. The sliding window operation is O(n), but it is dominated by the sorting step.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space beyond the input array.

        for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
            while (nums[right] - nums[left] > n - 1) {
                left++;
            }
            min_operations = min(min_operations, n - (right - left + 1));
        }

        return min_operations;
    }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `minimum_operations.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `MinimumOperations` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
