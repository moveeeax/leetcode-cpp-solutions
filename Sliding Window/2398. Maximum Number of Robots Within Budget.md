# **[Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-robots-within-budget/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of robots that can be activated given a budget constraint. Each robot has a specific cost to activate which is determined by their range and the cost of their battery. Our goal is to find the maximum number of robots we can activate while staying within budget, utilizing an efficient sliding window approach that maintains the total cost of the robots within that window.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Input Representation**: The inputs consist of two arrays: `chargeTimes`, which represents the charging time (or costs) of the robots, and `runningCosts`, which indicates the cost of keeping the robot running.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: We'll maintain a sliding window that records the number of robots that can be activated at any given time while accumulating their respective costs.
3. **Cost Calculation**: As we explore adding robots into our window, we will track the cumulative costs using two variables: one for the running costs and one for the charging times. When the total exceeds the budget, we slide the left end of the window.
4. **Maintaining Maximum Count**: Throughout the traversal of the array, we‚Äôll also keep track of the maximum number of robots activated that satisfied the budget constraint.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of robots. We traverse the array while maintaining our sliding window.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a fixed number of additional variables regardless of the input size.
