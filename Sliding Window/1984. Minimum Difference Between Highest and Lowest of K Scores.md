# **[Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires finding the minimum difference between the highest and lowest scores among any `k` scores selected from a list of `n` scores. The challenge lies in efficiently determining this minimum difference as the number of combinations can be quite large.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Scores**: The first step is to sort the list of scores. By sorting, we can ensure that for any `k` consecutive scores in this list, we can easily calculate the highest and lowest; the smallest element will be at the start and the largest at the end of that segment.
2. **Sliding Window**: Once sorted, we can use a sliding window of size `k` to check every segment of `k` scores in the sorted list. For each segment, calculate the difference between the highest and lowest scores and keep track of the minimum difference found.
3. **Iterate through Consecutive Segments**: Loop through the sorted list, from the start to `n-k`, and at each iteration calculate the difference for the current window of `k` scores. The smallest of these differences will be our answer.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), primarily due to sorting the scores. The sliding window takes O(n), leading to an overall time complexity dominated by the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of additional space regardless of the size of the input.

            int currentDifference = nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i];
            minDifference = min(minDifference, currentDifference);
