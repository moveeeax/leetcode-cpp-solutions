# **[Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array, allowing us to flip at most `k` 0s to 1s. The main challenge lies in efficiently tracking the longest sequence of 1s while handling the flips of 0s.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The optimal approach to solve this problem is using the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window where we count the number of 0s. If the number of zeros in the window exceeds `k`, we move the left end of the window to the right until we have at most `k` zeros. This way, we keep track of the maximum length of the window that contains at most `k` zeros. 

1. **Initialization**: Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to denote the current window, a variable to count the number of zeros, and a result variable to keep track of the maximum length found.
2. **Expanding the window**: As we iterate through the array with the `right` pointer, we expand our window by including the current element.
3. **Counting zeros**: If we encounter a zero, we increment the zero count.
4. **Shrinking the window**: If the zero count exceeds `k`, we increment the `left` pointer (shrink the window from the left) until we have at most `k` zeros again.
5. **Update result**: After adjusting the window, we check if the current window size (`right - left + 1`) is the largest found and update the result accordingly.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) since we traverse the array with two pointers (`left` and `right`).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space for storing indices and counts.
