# **[Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-consecutive-cards-to-pick-up/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves finding the minimum number of consecutive cards to be picked up from a deck of cards represented as an array. Specifically, if the same card appears at two different indices, we want to determine the minimum count of cards that lie between these two occurrences, including both endpoints. 

In essence:
- We traverse the `cards` array.
- For each unique card, we check the distance between its first and second occurrences to compute an interval that includes both occurrences.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structure**: We can utilize a hash map (or an unordered map in C++) to track the indices of the card values as we iterate through the array.
  
2. **Traversal & Distance Calculation**:
   - As we iterate, if we encounter a card that has already been seen (exists in the hash map), we calculate the distance between the current index and the last recorded index of that card.
   - We add 1 to this distance to account for both endpoints of the interval.
   - Keep track of the minimum distance observed.

3. **Result**: If the minimum distance remains unchanged, it means no duplicates were found, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return the minimum observed distance.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of cards, since we make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the storage of indices in the hash map.
