# **[Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-even-and-odd-frequency-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to determine the maximum difference between the counts of even and odd frequencies of characters in a string. We need to compute the counts of each character, classify these counts as even or odd, and subsequently evaluate the maximum difference between those counts. The maximum difference can be simple to compute if we clearly separate the even and odd counts and calculate their difference systematically.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Character Frequency Count**: Use a frequency array or map to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
2. **Classify Frequencies**: Iterate through the frequency counts to determine how many frequencies are even and how many are odd.
3. **Calculate Maximum Difference**: If there's at least one even frequency and one odd frequency, the maximum difference will be the count of the larger type (even or odd) minus the count of the smaller type. If only one type exists, the maximum difference is simply that count.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, return the computed maximum difference.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we make a single pass to count characters and another pass through the counts to classify them.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the character frequency counts are limited to the number of distinct characters (which is at most 26 for lowercase letters).

        // Classify frequencies into even and odd
        for (int count : frequency) {
            if (count > 0) { // count must be positive to consider it
                if (count % 2 == 0) {
