# **[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal is to find the length of the longest substring in a given string that contains all unique characters. A substring is any contiguous sequence of characters within the string. If a character repeats within a substring, we need to start from the next character and look for longer unique substrings, ensuring we keep track of the longest one we've found so far.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We will use two pointers to keep track of the current substring and a hash map (or an array) to remember the last index of each character we encounter.
2. **Expand the Window**: Start expanding the substring from the beginning. For each character, check if it has appeared before and is within the bounds of the current substring. If so, methodically move the start pointer to the right of the previous occurrence to avoid repeating characters.
3. **Update the Longest Length**: Continuously calculate the length of the current substring and update the maximum length found whenever a new character is included.
4. **Finish Iteration**: Continue this process until every character in the string has been considered.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the character set size. The extra space used is for the hash map to store the characters.

        unordered_map<char, int> charIndex;

        for (int end = 0; end < s.length(); end++) {
            if (charIndex.find(s[end]) != charIndex.end() && charIndex[s[end]] >= start) {
                start = charIndex[s[end]] + 1;
            }
            charIndex[s[end]] = end;
            maxLength = max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `LongestSubstring.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
