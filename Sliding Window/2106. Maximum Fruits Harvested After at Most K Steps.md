# **[Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-fruits-harvested-after-at-most-k-steps/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of fruits that can be harvested by moving left and right through a row of trees. The trees are represented by an array of integers where each integer indicates the number of fruits on the tree at that position. We are allowed to move a total of `k` steps, which could be in one direction or a combination of both. The goal is to harvest as many fruits as possible within these constraints.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain two pointers (or indices) to represent the boundaries of our current window, which will represent the segment of trees we are considering for harvesting fruits. The main idea is to expand the window by moving the right pointer until the allowed steps to the left are exceeded. Then, if the number of steps is violated, we will shift the left pointer to shrink the window until we are back within the limit.  

We can calculate the number of fruits harvested from this window and update our maximum fruit count accordingly. Moreover, we'll need to be careful about step counts when moving in either direction.  

1. Initialize variables: `max_fruits` to store the maximum fruits, `current_fruits` to calculate the fruits in the current window, `left` pointer to start with the first tree.
2. Iterate over the trees with a `right` pointer.
3. Calculate the length of the current segment and the steps taken.
4. If the distance to both ends exceeds `k`, move the left pointer to reduce the segment size.
5. Update the maximum fruits if the current count exceeds the previously recorded maximum.
  
### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of trees since each tree is visited at most twice (one for expanding and one for contracting the window).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
