# **[Maximize Win From Two Segments](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-win-from-two-segments/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to maximize the number of points earned from two segments of a given list by adhering to specific constraints. Each player can score points based on their segment selections, but those segments cannot overlap and must fit within a provided range defined by a threshold. 

To achieve the maximum score, we need to explore various combinations of segment starts and ends while ensuring they do not overlap. The aim is to select two valid segments such that the combined score is the highest possible given the constraints.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Points**: First, we need to sort the points array based on their values. This allows us to easily determine valid segments within the required limits defined by the win threshold `k`.
  
2. **Prefix Sum Array**: Create a prefix sum array for the sorted points. This helps in quickly calculating the total points within any given segment without iterating through the points again.

3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use a two-pointer approach to explore all possible segments. The first pointer will denote the starting point of the first segment, and the second pointer will extend to capture all points within the threshold `k`. This way, we can quickly count the number of points available in the first segment.

4. **Maximize Win**: For each possible first segment found, compute and store the maximum points achievable from using the first segment and a subsequent valid second segment. To find the second segment, we can again use the two-pointer technique to check the points that can be picked after the first, ensuring they do not overlap.

5. **Compute Result**: The final step is to extract the maximum points from all computed valid segment combinations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting the points and O(n) for the two-pointer traversal, overall making it O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the prefix sums and pointers.
