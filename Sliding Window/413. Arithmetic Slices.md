# **[Arithmetic Slices](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count all possible arithmetic subarrays (slices) within a given integer array. An arithmetic subarray is defined as a contiguous subarray of at least three elements where the difference between consecutive elements is constant. For instance, an array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` contains multiple arithmetic slices, including `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, and `[1, 2, 3, 4]` itself.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a linear scan through the array with a variable to track the number of current arithmetic slices:
1. Start by checking the differences between consecutive elements.
2. Whenever we find that the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements is the same as the difference between the `(i-1)-th` and `(i-2)-th`, we can extend the current arithmetic slice.
3. If the slice is valid (i.e., contains at least three elements), we count the new additions to the arithmetic slices based on the number of elements we can extend from the current valid sequence.
4. If the condition is not met, reset the counting.
5. Sum up the counts as we go along.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We traverse the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few variables for counting and tracking the state.

                count++;
                total += count;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }

        for (int i = 2; i < A.size(); i++) {
            if (A[i] - A[i - 1] == A[i - 1] - A[i - 2]) {
                count++;
                total += count;
            } else {
