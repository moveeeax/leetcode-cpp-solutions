# **[Count Substrings With K-Frequency Characters I](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-with-k-frequency-characters-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires counting the number of substrings in a given string where exactly `k` distinct characters have a frequency greater than or equal to 1. Essentially, we need to find all possible substrings and determine which of these substrings satisfy the condition of containing `k` distinct characters. A common approach to such problems is to use a sliding window along with a frequency map (dictionary) to count the occurrences of each character dynamically.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can employ a sliding window technique accompanied by two helper functions. We'll maintain a left and right pointer (the window boundaries) and a frequency map for characters in this window. The core steps are:

1. **Count Substrings with At Most K Unique Characters**: Create a helper function that calculates the number of substrings with at most `k` distinct characters using two pointers (left and right). The right pointer expands the window by adding characters, while the left pointer contracts it to ensure that we do not exceed the allowed number of distinct characters.

2. **Calculate Substrings with Exactly K Unique Characters**: Use the previously created helper function. The number of substrings with exactly `k` distinct characters can be obtained by the difference of results from the two helper calls: count(at most `k`) - count(at most `k-1`).

By invoking this mechanism, we can efficiently calculate the desired count without redundantly checking each substring individually.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n). We move both pointers across the string, hence traversing it a constant number of times leads to a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). Since the frequency map will only hold data for a fixed number of lowercase characters (26 English letters), the space used is constant.

        for (int right = 0; right < s.size(); ++right) {
            if (charCount[s[right]]++ == 0) {
                k--;
            }
            
            while (k < 0) {
                if (--charCount[s[left]] == 0) {
                    k++;
                }
                left++;
