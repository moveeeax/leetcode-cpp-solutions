# **[Maximum Length Substring With Two Occurrences](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-substring-with-two-occurrences/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of this problem is to find the length of the longest substring in a given string `s` that contains exactly two distinct characters that occur at least once. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The challenge lies in determining how to effectively track the characters present in the substring and their respective counts to ensure exactly two distinct characters are being considered.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem efficiently, we can apply the sliding window technique along with a hash map to count occurrences of characters in the current window. 

1. **Sliding Window Setup**: We maintain two pointers to represent the current window's boundaries. The left pointer indicates the start, while the right pointer indicates the end of the window.
  
2. **Character Count Tracking**: Use a hash map (or array) to maintain the count of each character currently in the window.

3. **Expand and Contract the Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving the right pointer to include more characters.
   - Whenever the number of unique characters exceeds two, move the left pointer to reduce the window size until there are only two distinct characters left.
   
4. **Calculate Length**: Each time the window contains exactly two distinct characters, calculate its length and update the maximum length found so far.

5. **Return the Result**: After processing the entire string, return the maximum length of any valid substring found.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once by the left pointer and once by the right pointer).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for character count since we are only dealing with the lowercase English letters (26 possible characters).
