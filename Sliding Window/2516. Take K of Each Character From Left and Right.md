# **[Take K of Each Character From Left and Right](https://leetcode.com/problems/take-k-of-each-character-from-left-and-right/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to construct a string by taking a specified number of characters (k) from both the left and the right of a given string, while adhering to certain constraints. We must handle cases where the characters' counts can be limited by their occurrences in the string. Therefore, the main challenge lies in ensuring that we do not exceed the maximum available count of any character while building the final result.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Character Counting**: First, we need to count the frequency of each character in the input string. This will help us determine how many characters we can take when processing from both the left and the right.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: We will use two pointers‚Äîone starting from the left end and another from the right end of the string. As we take characters from both sides, we'll maintain a count of how many we have already taken for each character.

3. **Building the Result**: We'll take characters from the left up to k times, then similarly take characters from the right, ensuring that the total taken does not exceed k for any character. This will allow us to balance the characters taken from each side.

4. **Constructing the Final String**: Once we have determined the characters to take from both sides, we will construct the final result by concatenating pieces of the string as dictated by our earlier steps.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string to build the character count and then again to take characters based on the counts.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if we consider the frequency count of characters, since the total number of unique characters is bounded by the alphabet size (constant).

            }
        }
        
        // Reverse right since we collected it from the end
        reverse(right.begin(), right.end());
