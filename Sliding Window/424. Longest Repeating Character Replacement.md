# **[Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about finding the length of the longest substring that can be obtained from the input string by replacing at most `k` characters. Given a string consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer `k`, we need to achieve the longest substring where all characters are the same after replacements. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle the problem, a sliding window approach will be employed:
1. We maintain a window defined by two indices `left` and `right` which represents the current substring we are evaluating.
2. As we expand the `right` index, we will track the frequency of characters within the current window using an array.
3. The window will continue expanding until we find that the length of the current window minus the highest frequency character count exceeds `k` (meaning we need more than `k` replacements to make all characters the same).
4. When this happens, we will increment the `left` index to reduce the size of the window, effectively making fewer characters to replace.
5. Throughout the process, we will keep track of the maximum length of valid windows encountered.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we traverse the string with two pointers at most once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we utilize an array of fixed size (26 for uppercase English letters) for frequency counting.

            max_count = max(max_count, ++count[s[right] - 'A']);

            while (right - left + 1 - max_count > k) {
                count[s[left] - 'A']--;
                left++;
            }

            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1);

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `solution.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> count(26, 0);
        int left = 0, max_count = 0, max_length = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.size(); right++) {
            max_count = max(max_count, ++count[s[right] - 'A']);

            while (right - left + 1 - max_count > k) {
                count[s[left] - 'A']--;
                left++;
            }

            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return max_length;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string s;
    int k;

    cout << "Enter the string: ";
    cin >> s;
    cout << "Enter the value of k: ";
    cin >> k;

    int result = solution.characterReplacement(s, k);
    cout << "The length of the longest substring is: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
