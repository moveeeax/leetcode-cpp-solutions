## 🚀 How to Use

### **💻 Running a Solution**
To **compile and run** LeetCode-style C++ code **locally**, you need to:
1. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside a `main()` function.
2. **Include necessary headers** (`#include <iostream>, <vector>, <unordered_map>`)
3. **Provide input handling** for the `twoSum()` function.
4. **Compile and run** the program.

---

### **✅ Steps**
1. **Create a file**: `two_sum.cpp`
2. **Add a `main()` function** to call `Solution::twoSum()`.
3. **Compile using `g++`**.
4. **Run the executable**.

---

### **📝 Full Working Code (`two_sum.cpp`)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (m.count(complement)) return {m[complement], i};
            m[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {};
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;

    // Input handling
    vector<int> nums;
    int target, n;

    cout << "Enter number of elements: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    cout << "Enter elements: ";
    nums.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> nums[i];

    cout << "Enter target: ";
    cin >> target;

    // Run twoSum function
    vector<int> result = solution.twoSum(nums, target);

    // Output result
    if (!result.empty()) {
        cout << "Indices: [" << result[0] << ", " << result[1] << "]" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No solution found!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **🔧 Compilation & Execution**
#### **1️⃣ Compile the C++ Code**
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 two_sum.cpp -o two_sum
```

#### **2️⃣ Run the Program**
```bash
./two_sum
```

---

### **🎯 Example Run**
#### **Input**
```
Enter number of elements: 4
Enter elements: 2 7 11 15
Enter target: 9
```
#### **Output**
```
Indices: [0, 1]
```

---

### **📌 Summary**
✅ **Wraps the LeetCode `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
✅ **Handles user input** for array and target  
✅ **Compiles and runs locally** using `g++`  
✅ **Displays output in a readable format**  

🚀 **Now you can test LeetCode C++ solutions locally!** 🚀
