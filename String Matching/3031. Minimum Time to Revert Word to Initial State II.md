# **[Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-revert-word-to-initial-state-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds needed to revert a string back to its initial state, given a set of defined operations that can rearrange the letters in the string. Each operation can either reverse the string or reverse half of it, and these operations can be applied in various sequences.

To understand the problem intuitively, consider that a string can be thought of as a cycle upon getting manipulated. After two complete cycles, the string should revert back to its original state. This insight leads to the conclusion that the total time required to revert back entirely is equivalent to brewing this cycle back from its altered state.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The approach involves determining the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the string divided by 2 (if the length is even), or the length itself (if odd). The reasoning for this focus on LCM is based on the fact that you need a common time period in which both sequences meet at their start position.

1. **Calculate the length of the string.**  
2. **Determine LCM of substring and full length as needed.**  
3. **Return the computed time in seconds.**  

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as the main operations involve simple calculations based on string properties.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since no additional space is required that grows with input size.
