# **[Sum of Scores of Built Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-scores-of-built-strings/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about determining the total score of built strings based on certain scores assigned to substrings of a given base string. The score of a substring is defined by its length and contributions from repeated characters. We need to efficiently calculate the sum of these scores for all possible substrings of given strings. We can utilize a dynamic programming approach to maintain the scores of each substring while iterating through the characters.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total score.
2. For each character in the input string, build the substrings starting from that character and calculate their score based on the defined rules.
3. Use a helper structure to store the last occurrence of each character to handle repetitions effectively.
4. For every starting index in the string, calculate the score for substrings extending from that index and accumulate them into a total score.
5. Return the final accumulated score for the input.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) where n is the length of the string (because we potentially consider every substring).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we do not use any extra space that scales with the input size, aside from a few variables.

            int count = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                count++;
                totalScore += count;

                // Update the last seen index for the character
                last[s[j] - 'a'] = j + 1;
            }

            // Reset last seen indices for the next iteration
            fill(begin(last), end(last), 0);
        }
        return totalScore;
    }
};  
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `sum_of_scores.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()` with test cases.  
3. **Include necessary headers**.  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**.  
5. **Compile and run the program**.
