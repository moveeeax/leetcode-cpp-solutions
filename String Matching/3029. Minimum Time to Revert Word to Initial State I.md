# **[Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State I](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-revert-word-to-initial-state-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum time needed to revert a string (or word) back to its initial state after performing certain operations. In this context, we can think of "reverting" as a series of directional movements over the characters in the string. Each character can be rotated (shifted) either to the left or to the right, and the time taken for each movement is dictated by a specific value associated with each character.

The initial state of the string is the order in which we received it, and we need to find the most optimal method to revert it to that order in the least amount of time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding Operations**: For each character in the string, we can either move left or right. Each movement has a time cost associated with it derived from the character's value. If a character is moved left, its time is given by the corresponding value in a designated array. The same applies for movements to the right.
  
2. **Tracking Initial State Cost**: We need to compute how much time it takes to revert the string back to its original configuration based on given movement costs.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: We can utilize a dynamic programming (DP) array to keep track of the minimum time taken to revert the string. The DP approach allows optimal substructure, meaning we can build on previously calculated results to come up with the solution for the current state.

4. **Iterative Calculation**: We will iterate through the string and evaluate the time cost required to revert each character to its initial position. We‚Äôll keep updating our DP array based on minimum time computed so far, at each step.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), primarily to store the DP results.

                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + (i - j) * time[j]);
