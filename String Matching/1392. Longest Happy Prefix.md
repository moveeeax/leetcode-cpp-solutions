# **[Longest Happy Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-prefix/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about finding the longest prefix of a string that is also a suffix, yet not equal to the entire string. This concept relates to string processing and algorithms such as the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm, which uses prefix tables to identify overlaps in a string. 

A happy prefix is essentially a contiguous substring from the start that appears again at the end of the string. For instance, in the string "level", the longest happy prefix would be "l" since it's both a prefix and a suffix but is not equal to the full string.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. The easiest way to identify prefixes and suffixes is to iterate from both ends of the string.
2. We will initialize a `length` variable to keep track of the longest happy prefix found.
3. Using a loop, we will compare the characters from the start of the string with the characters from the end, moving inward while they match.
4. As soon as they see a mismatch, we stop the process; however, we need to ensure that the happy prefix length is not equal to the length of the entire string.
5. Return the substring of the happy prefix from the original string based on the length found.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we may need to traverse the entire string in worst-case scenarios.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space for indices and variables.

                length++;
            } else {
                while (length > 0 && s[i] != s[length]) {
                    length--; // Backtrack in case of mismatch
