# **[Maximum Repeating Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-repeating-substring/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times a substring appears consecutively in a given string. We are tasked with finding a substring of the given string `s` which can be repeatedly concatenated to form a longer substring that exists in `s`. The goal is to find the maximum integer `k` for which there exists a substring `sub` such that `sub` appears exactly `k` times in a row in string `s`. 

For example, if `s = "ababc"` and `sub = "ab"`, then the substring `"ab"` appears `k = 2` times in the sequence `"abab"`, which is not complete in `s`, so we check for valid consecutive occurrences of substrings.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can:
1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from `1` to `n / k`, where `n` is the length of the string.
2. For each possible length, check if the substring of that length can be repeated consecutively.
3. For each substring encountered, count how many times it can consecutively appear.
4. Update the maximum count if the current count exceeds the previous maximum.

The algorithm can be efficiently realized using a nested loop where the outer loop decides the substring length and the inner loop counts its consecutive occurrences.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) - we might examine every possible substring and count its occurrences.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - we are using only a few variables for counting.
