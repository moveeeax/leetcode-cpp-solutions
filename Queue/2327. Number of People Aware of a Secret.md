# **[Number of People Aware of a Secret](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-people-aware-of-a-secret/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine how many people are aware of a secret after a certain number of days, given specific conditions surrounding the spread of this secret. Initially, only one person knows the secret. Each day, that person shares the secret with a certain number of people, and some of those people will later share the secret according to the rules defined. The key understanding is when people receive the secret and their ability to spread it onward after a delay.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start by understanding how many people start with the secret and over how many days the secret can spread.
2. **Simulate the Spread**: For each day, determine how many new people become aware of the secret based on those who already know it and the constraints that dictate when they can share the secret.
3. **Keep Track of Aware People**: Use cumulative counts for efficiency to avoid recalculating the number of people aware of the secret repeatedly.
4. **Constrain to a Month**: Since we are only interested in the number of people aware of the secret after `days`, careful management of those who share the secret and when they can share it will be crucial.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(days) ‚Äî We iterate through each day and update the count, which is efficient since we only perform simple arithmetic.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) ‚Äî We only use a fixed amount of space to store counts and no additional data structures grow with input size.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int peopleAwareOfSecret(int days, int forget) {
        long long total = 0;  // Total number of people who know the secret
        long long new_people = 1;  // Initially, only one person knows
        vector<long long> dp(days + 1, 0);  // Create a dp array to keep track of new people per day
        
        // The first person starts the secret today
        dp[1] = new_people;
        
        for (int day = 1; day <= days; day++) {
            // Only keep track of the number of new people who learned the secret today
            if (day + forget <= days) {
                dp[day + forget] += dp[day]; // After 'forget' days, they can no longer share
            }
            // Calculate how many new people are aware of the secret
            total = (total + dp[day]) % 1000000007; // Update total and ensure we take mod
        }
        
        return total; // Return the total number of people who are aware after 'days'
    }
};

    // Example input
    days = 4; 
    forget = 1;

    // Function call
    int result = solution.peopleAwareOfSecret(days, forget);
    
    // Output the result
    cout << result << endl; // Expected output should be checked as per examples
