# **[Number of Recent Calls](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to track the number of calls made in the last 3000 milliseconds. For every call made using the `ping` method, we need to determine how many calls occurred in the last 3000 milliseconds including the current call. This involves managing the timing of previous calls and ensuring we count only those calls that fall within the 3000 millisecond window from the current time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a queue-like structure to store the timestamps of the calls. Each time we call the `ping` method:

1. We capture the current timestamp.
2. We add this timestamp to a list of recent calls.
3. We remove any timestamps from the list that fall outside the 3000 millisecond window. This is done by iterating from the front of the list and removing any old entries.
4. The size of the list at the end tells us how many recent calls were made within the last 3000 milliseconds.

This model allows efficient management of the call timestamps while ensuring that we only store relevant ones.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for appending a new call and O(k) for cleaning up old calls where k is the number of calls that are older than 3000 ms. In the worst case, this can still be managed efficiently with the right data structure.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of calls stored in the list.

```cpp
class RecentCounter {
public:
    vector<int> calls;

    RecentCounter() {
        calls.reserve(3000); // Reserve space for efficiency, max range in milliseconds.
    }
    
    int ping(int t) {
        calls.push_back(t); // Add current time to the calls.
        
        // Remove calls that are older than t - 3000
        while (!calls.empty() && calls.front() < t - 3000) {
            calls.erase(calls.begin()); // Remove the oldest calls.
        }
        
        return calls.size(); // The size of the remaining calls is the answer.
    }
};
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `NumberOfRecentCalls.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `RecentCounter` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

    }
    
    int ping(int t) {
        calls.push_back(t); // Add current time to the calls.
        
        // Remove calls that are older than t - 3000
        while (!calls.empty() && calls.front() < t - 3000) {
            calls.erase(calls.begin()); // Remove the oldest calls.
        }
        
        return calls.size(); // The size of the remaining calls is the answer.
    }
};

int main() {
    RecentCounter rc;
    cout << rc.ping(1) << endl;    // return 1
    cout << rc.ping(100) << endl;  // return 2
    cout << rc.ping(3001) << endl; // return 3
