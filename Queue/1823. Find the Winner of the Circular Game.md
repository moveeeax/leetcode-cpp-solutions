# **[Find the Winner of the Circular Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-the-circular-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are tasked with simulating a circular elimination game. We have `n` players arranged in a circle, and they are sequentially eliminated based on a counting scheme until we are left with one player. The goal here is to determine which player will be the last one remaining after all other players have been eliminated. 

The key components are:
- **Players**: Numbered from `1` to `n`.
- **Elimination**: The counting step (`k`) determines which player gets eliminated at each round. The elimination starts from the first player, and counting proceeds circularly.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
Since simulating the entire game could be inefficient, we can directly compute the winner using a mathematical approach based on the Josephus problem, which describes a similar elimination game.

1. **Recursive Definition**: 
   - The winner for `n` players can be defined recursively. If we know the winner of `n-1` players, we can compute the winner of `n` players with the formula:
     \[
     \text{winner}(n, k) = (\text{winner}(n-1, k) + k) \% n
     \]
   - The base case is when there is only one player, the winner is the only player left.

2. **Iterative Approach**: 
   - We can convert this recursive definition into an iterative form. Starting from one player and iteratively calculating for all sizes up to `n`.
   - The winner is adjusted using modulo to wrap around the circular structure of the arrangement.

3. **Final Adjustment**: 
   - Since the player numbers start from `1` but our computation starts from `0`, we need to add `1` to the final result.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We perform the calculation iteratively for each player from `1` to `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We only use a few variables to keep track of the current winner.

public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        int winner = 0; // Base case: when there's 1 person, they are the winner.
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            winner = (winner + k) % i; // Calculate the winner's position in the current circle size.
        }
        return winner + 1; // Convert from 0-based to 1-based index.
    }
};  
```

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            winner = (winner + k) % i; // Calculate the winner's position in the current circle size.
        }
        return winner + 1; // Convert from 0-based to 1-based index.
    }
