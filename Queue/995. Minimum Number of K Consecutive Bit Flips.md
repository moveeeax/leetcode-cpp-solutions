# **[Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of flips needed to convert a binary string into a target state where all characters in the string are '0'. We can only flip at most `k` consecutive bits at a time. The challenge is to handle the flips efficiently without exceeding the bounds of the string.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start by setting up variables to count the number of flips needed and to keep track of the current state (whether the current bit is effectively flipped or not). 
2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through each bit in the string. For each bit:
   - Check if it needs to be flipped (i.e., if its value seems to be '1' based on previous flips).
   - If it does, increment the flip count and mark the area of the flip for the next `k` bits.
   - Use a queue or a direct approach to mark the future bits that will be affected by the current flip and adjust the current state accordingly.
3. **Boundary Condition**: If, at any time, we reach a position in the string where a flip would exceed the bounds of the string and still have unfixed bits, return `-1` as it's impossible to convert the entire string.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the binary string. We are effectively making a single pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few variables for tracking states and counts.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            flipCount ^= flipTracker[i]; // Get the current effective state of A[i]
            if (A[i] ^ flipCount == 0) { // We need to flip it to make it '1'
                if (i + K > n) return -1; // Out of bounds for flipping
                flips++;
                flipCount ^= 1; // Toggle the flip effect
                flipTracker[i + K] ^= 1; // Reset effect after K bits
            }
