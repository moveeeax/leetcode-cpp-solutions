# **[Longest Increasing Subsequence II](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to determine the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array, but it comes with a twist: we're allowed to modify at most `k` elements to make the sequence increasing. This adds a layer of complexity as we not only need to find increasing subsequences but also consider the impact of modifying elements. 

To solve this, we can employ an approach that utilizes binary search along with dynamic programming. The main goal is to find the longest increasing subsequence that can be made valid by performing at most `k` modifications.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**: 
    - We'll maintain an array `dp` where each element represents the smallest possible tail of an increasing subsequence of a given length in the original array.
    - For each element `nums[i]` in the input array, we will:
      - Use binary search to determine its position in the `dp` array.
      - If `nums[i]` can extend the existing subsequence, we add it to `dp`.
      - If not, we consider it as a candidate for modification.

2. **Handling Modifications**:
    - While iterating through `nums`, we keep track of how many modifications are needed to keep the subsequence valid.
    - We can only afford modifications if they do not exceed `k`.

3. **Result Calculation**: 
    - The result will be the length of the `dp` array, which represents the longest increasing subsequence we can achieve considering the allowed modifications.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) ‚Äì the main factor is the binary search over the `dp` array, performed for each element in `nums` which has n elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) ‚Äì we use a separate array `dp` to store the potential tail elements.

            if (dp.empty() || dp.back() < nums[i]) {
                dp.push_back(nums[i]);
            } else {
                int l = 0, r = dp.size();
                while (l < r) {
                    int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
                    if (dp[mid] < nums[i]) {
                        l = mid + 1;
                    } else {
                        r = mid;
                    }
                }
