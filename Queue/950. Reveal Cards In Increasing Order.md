# **[Reveal Cards In Increasing Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to reveal cards in a specific order based on their original positions after being shuffled. We are given an array of integers that represent the deck of cards, and the goal is to reveal these cards in increasing order while simulating how the cards are placed and revealed.

The process involves:
1. Sorting the array to get the cards in increasing order.
2. Using a queue (or a similar structure) to simulate the revealing and placing back of the cards as specified.

To achieve our objective, we need to create a new array that will hold the positions of cards in the order they will be revealed.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Cards**: First, we sort the input array of cards to know the order in which they should be revealed.
2. **Simulated Indexing**: We use two data structures:
   - A vector to hold the final order of cards.
   - A deque (double-ended queue) to simulate the position where the next card will go after revealing and placing back.
3. **Revealing Cards**:
   - Iterate over the sorted cards.
   - For each card, we either place it in the next available position from the back of the list or insert it in a way that simulates the reveal and shuffle process.

By carefully managing our index placements using the deque, we can maintain the sequences required for revealing the cards.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) because of the sorting step, where n is the number of cards.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for maintaining the final result and any temporary storage.
