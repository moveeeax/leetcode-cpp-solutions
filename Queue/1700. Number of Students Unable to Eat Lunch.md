# **[Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-students-unable-to-eat-lunch/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find out how many students are unable to eat lunch given their lunch choices and the number of lunchboxes available. Each student wants a specific type of lunch, indicated by a list of integers where each integer represents a type of lunch. If a student‚Äôs preferred lunch is unavailable, they cannot eat lunch at all.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this, we will:
1. Count the occurrences of each lunch type from the array of student preferences.
2. Compare this count to the count of available lunchboxes for each type.
3. Calculate the total number of students who cannot get their preferred lunch by subtracting the number of available lunchboxes from the number of requested lunchboxes for that type.
4. Return the total count of students who cannot eat lunch.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of students. We traverse the list of lunch preferences once and perform constant-time operations for counting.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if we disregard the input size since we only keep a fixed number of counts for the lunch types which is limited (2 types in this case).

public:
    int countStudents(vector<int>& students, vector<int>& sandwiches) {
        int cnt0 = count(students.begin(), students.end(), 0);
        int cnt1 = count(students.begin(), students.end(), 1);
        int cnt0Sandwiches = count(sandwiches.begin(), sandwiches.end(), 0);
        int cnt1Sandwiches = count(sandwiches.begin(), sandwiches.end(), 1);
        
        return max(0, cnt0 - cnt0Sandwiches) + max(0, cnt1 - cnt1Sandwiches);
    }
};  
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `number_of_students_unable_to_eat_lunch.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `NumberOfStudentsUnableToEatLunch` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class NumberOfStudentsUnableToEatLunch {
public:
    int countStudents(vector<int>& students, vector<int>& sandwiches) {
        int cnt0 = count(students.begin(), students.end(), 0);
        int cnt1 = count(students.begin(), students.end(), 1);
        int cnt0Sandwiches = count(sandwiches.begin(), sandwiches.end(), 0);
        int cnt1Sandwiches = count(sandwiches.begin(), sandwiches.end(), 1);
        
        return max(0, cnt0 - cnt0Sandwiches) + max(0, cnt1 - cnt1Sandwiches);
    }
};

int main() {
    NumberOfStudentsUnableToEatLunch solution;
    
    vector<int> students = {1, 1, 0, 0};
    vector<int> sandwiches = {0, 1, 0, 1};
    
    cout << solution.countStudents(students, sandwiches) << endl; // Output: 0

    return 0;
}  
```
