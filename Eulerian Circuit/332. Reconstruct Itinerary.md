# **[Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem of reconstructing an itinerary involves finding a path through various airports represented as a directed graph where each airport can be visited and connected by flights. The requirement is to start from "JFK" and ensure an orderly itinerary by using all given flights in lexicographical order. This challenge resembles a depth-first search (DFS) on an adjacency list, requiring us to backtrack when forming the full path.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to store the flights, where each airport points to a list of airports it can reach. Since we want to visit the airports in lexicographical order, we'll use a min-heap (priority queue) to sort the outgoing flights.
2. **DFS Exploration**: Starting from "JFK", we perform a DFS to explore all flights. At each airport, we try to use an available flight (if exists), marking it as used. After visiting the flight, we backtrack to explore alternate paths.
3. **Path Formation**: Whenever we reach our goal of visiting all airports, the path is constructed. We ensure that when finalizing the path, the airports are in the correct sequence.
4. **Result Construction**: Finally, the path (itinerary) is reversed, as our traversal accumulates results in reverse order of visits.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(E log E) where E is the number of flights, dominated by the sorting of flights for each airport.
- **Space Complexity**: O(E + V) where V is the number of vertices (unique airports) and E is the number of edges (flights).
