# **[Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires identifying the minimum height trees (MHTs) in a directed graph represented as an undirected graph. A minimum height tree is defined as a tree where the longest path from the root to any leaf is minimized. Given a set of edges defining connections between nodes, we need to find the vertices that can serve as roots for such trees.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To find minimum height trees, we can use a graph processing technique called topological sorting via the concept of layers. The approach uses the following key steps:
1. **Build the Graph**: First, we'll create an adjacency list representation of the undirected graph using the given edges.
2. **Identify Leaf Nodes**: The nodes with a degree of 1 are considered leaves (except when there are fewer than two nodes).
3. **Remove Leaves Iteratively**: We will iteratively remove these leaves from the graph. For each round of leaf removal, we will keep track of the nodes that become new leaves.
4. **Stop Condition**: When only one or two nodes are left, these nodes will constitute the roots of the minimum height trees.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges because we process each node and edge a limited number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), for storing the adjacency list of the graph and the degree counts.
