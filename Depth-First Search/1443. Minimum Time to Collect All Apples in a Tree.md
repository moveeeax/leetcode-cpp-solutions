# **[Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-collect-all-apples-in-a-tree/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a tree represented as an undirected graph, where nodes represent apples and edges represent paths between nodes. The goal is to determine the minimum time required to collect all the apples. The time taken for each edge traversed is 1 unit, and we are only concerned with traversing those edges which lead to nodes that contain apples. The challenge lies in efficiently traversing the tree while ignoring unnecessary paths.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS). We will traverse from the root node (assuming node 0 is the root) and recursively check the paths to find out if we need to traverse them based on whether they lead to an apple. 

1. **Construct the Graph**: We begin by constructing an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **DFS Traversal**: We perform a DFS starting from the root node. At each node:
   - Check all its children.
   - If a child has an apple (or can lead to a subtree with apples), we traverse to that child.
   - Count the edges traversed and return the total time required to collect all apples.
3. **Calculate Time**: The total time to collect apples will be twice the number of edges traversed (to and from the child) for any edge that leads to an apple.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes (or edges in the tree), because each node is visited once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), which is used for the adjacency list representation of the tree.
