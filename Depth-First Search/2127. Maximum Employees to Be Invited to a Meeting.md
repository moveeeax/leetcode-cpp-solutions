# **[Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-employees-to-be-invited-to-a-meeting/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around determining the maximum number of employees that can be invited to a meeting, given certain constraints. Each employee has a list of other employees they cannot meet with. Therefore, we need to find the largest group of employees such that no two employees in this group are directly connected via the constraints. 

Essentially, this can be modeled as a graph problem where:
- Each employee is a vertex.
- Each constraint (the list of employees an employee cannot meet) is an edge between those vertices.

The core of the problem is finding a maximum independent set in this graph, which is a known NP-complete problem. However, since the constraints are small enough, we can use a backtracking approach with pruning to explore feasible combinations efficiently.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: We will use an adjacency list to represent the graph where each employee points to the list of employees they cannot meet.
2. **Backtracking Function**: We will define a recursive function that explores all possible subsets of employees, marking them as included or excluded, based on the constraints from the adjacency list.
3. **Pruning**: During the exploration, if an employee already included in the current subset can't meet an already included employee, we will discard that subset early.
4. **Count the Maximum**: As we backtrack, we will maintain and update the count of the maximum viable subset of employees.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), where n is the number of employees, due to the exponential nature of the recursive backtracking algorithm trying all subsets.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the storage of the adjacency list and for the recursive stack.
