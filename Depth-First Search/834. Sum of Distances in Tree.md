# **[Sum of Distances in Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to compute the sum of distances from each node to all other nodes in a tree structure. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and the distance between two nodes is the number of edges in the path connecting them. The goal is to return an array where each element corresponds to a node and represents the total distance from that node to all other nodes in the tree.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS to traverse nodes of the tree and calculate initial distances and counts of subtrees.
2. **Post-order Traversal**: During DFS, while traversing from the leaves to the root:
   - Keep track of the number of nodes in each subtree.
   - Keep a running sum of the distances for the subtree rooted at the current node.
3. **Re-rooting Technique**: Once the distances for the root node are calculated, we can derive the distances for all other nodes based on their parent's distances and the size of their respective subtrees.
   - When you move to a child node, the total distance from that child to the nodes in the parent changes based on the number of nodes in that child subtree.
4. **Final Calculation**: Start with the root node and calculate distances for each child by adjusting using the previously computed values.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the tree as an adjacency list and for the recursion stack.
