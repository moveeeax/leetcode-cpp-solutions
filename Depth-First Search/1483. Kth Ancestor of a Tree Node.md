# **[Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-ancestor-of-a-tree-node/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
We are given a tree represented as a parent array, where the index corresponds to the node, and the value at that index corresponds to the parent of that node. We need to find the k-th ancestor of a given node in this tree structure. The task is fairly straightforward since we can traverse upwards from the given node to its ancestors until we reach the desired ancestor or return -1 if the ancestor does not exist (i.e., `k` is larger than the height of the tree from the given node).

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Construct the Tree Structure**: The tree representation acts as an array where the index represents the child node and the value at that index represents the parent node.
2. **Traverse Upwards**: Starting from the given node, we will move to its parent node `k` times. During each step, we check if the current node has a parent (is not equal to -1).
3. **Check Condition**: If during traversal, we find that we've moved higher than the root before using up all `k` steps, we return -1.
   
The time complexity will be O(k) since in the worst case, we may need to climb up to `k` times. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a few variables to track the current node and for loop counters.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(k)  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `kth_ancestor.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `TreeAncestor` class and testing code inside `main()`**  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class TreeAncestor {
public:
    std::vector<int> parent;

    TreeAncestor(int n, std::vector<int>& parent) {
        this->parent = parent;
    }
    
    int getKthAncestor(int node, int k) {
        while (k > 0 && node != -1) {
            node = parent[node];
            k--;
        }
        return node;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<int> parent = {-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2}; // Sample parent array representing the tree
    TreeAncestor ta(6, parent);
    
    std::cout << ta.getKthAncestor(5, 2) << std::endl; // Expected output: 0
    std::cout << ta.getKthAncestor(5, 3) << std::endl; // Expected output: -1
    std::cout << ta.getKthAncestor(4, 1) << std::endl; // Expected output: 1
    
    return 0;
}
```
