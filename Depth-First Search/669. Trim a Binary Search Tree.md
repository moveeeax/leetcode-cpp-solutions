# **[Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem requires us to trim a binary search tree according to provided bounds `[low, high]`. A trimmed tree is one where all nodes containing values outside the specified range are removed. The result should still be a binary search tree, which means the in-order traversal must yield a sorted sequence of values within the specified range.

### **🚀 Approach**  
We can solve the problem using a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach. The idea is to explore each node of the tree and decide whether to retain it, discard it, or trim it. 

The key steps are:
1. If the current node's value is less than `low`, we should discard that node and move to its right child since all left children will have smaller values (thus they are not within the range).
2. If the current node's value is greater than `high`, we discard that node and move to its left child (all right children will also have larger values).
3. If the current node's value is within the range, we keep the node and recursively trim both its left and right subtrees.

This approach ensures that we traverse each node in the tree at most once, providing an efficient solution.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (worst case O(n) for a degenerate tree but O(log n) for a balanced tree due to recursion stack space).

## **2️⃣ LeetCode Submission**  
```cpp
class TrimBinarySearchTree {
public:
    TreeNode* trimBST(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
        if (!root) return nullptr; // Base case: when the current node is null

        // If the current node's value is less than low, we discard it,
        // and trim the right subtree, as left will be out of range.
        if (root->val < low) 
            return trimBST(root->right, low, high);

        // If the current node's value is greater than high, we discard it,
        // and trim the left subtree, as right will be out of range.
        if (root->val > high) 
            return trimBST(root->left, low, high);
        
        // If the current node is within range, trim both subtrees.
        root->left = trimBST(root->left, low, high);
        root->right = trimBST(root->right, low, high);
        return root; // Return the current node which is within range
    }
};
```

## **3️⃣ Running Locally**  
### **✅ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `trim_bst.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `TrimBinarySearchTree` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

        if (!root) return nullptr; // Base case: when the current node is null

        // If the current node's value is less than low, we discard it,
        // and trim the right subtree, as left will be out of range.
        if (root->val < low) 
            return trimBST(root->right, low, high);

        // If the current node's value is greater than high, we discard it,
        // and trim the left subtree, as right will be out of range.
        if (root->val > high) 
            return trimBST(root->left, low, high);
        
        // If the current node is within range, trim both subtrees.
        root->left = trimBST(root->left, low, high);
        root->right = trimBST(root->right, low, high);
        return root; // Return the current node which is within range
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage and test (construct a tree, call trimBST, print the result)
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left = new TreeNode(0);
    root->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(-1);
    
    TrimBinarySearchTree solution;
    TreeNode* trimmedTree = solution.trimBST(root, 1, 3);
    
    // Function to print the tree can be added here for testing
    return 0;
