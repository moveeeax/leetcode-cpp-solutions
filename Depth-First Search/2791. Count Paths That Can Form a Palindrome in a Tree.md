# **[Count Paths That Can Form a Palindrome in a Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-paths-that-can-form-a-palindrome-in-a-tree/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of this problem is to find how many paths from the root to the leaves of a binary tree can be rearranged to form a palindrome. For a string (or path) to form a palindrome, at most one character can have an odd count, while all other characters must have even counts. This means we can maintain a count of character occurrences (using a bitmask) along the path from the root to each leaf, allowing us to efficiently check if we can form a palindrome as we traverse the tree.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Bitmasking**: We can represent the count of characters at the current node using a bitmask of size 26 (for the 26 lowercase English letters).
2. **DFS Traversal**: We will perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree. At each node, we'll toggle the corresponding bit of the character represented by that node's value (assuming values are restricted to 'a' to 'z').
3. **Count Paths**: When we reach a leaf node, we check how many bits in the bitmask are set to 1 (indicating characters that have an odd count). If there's at most one bit set, we increment our count of valid paths.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, for the recursion stack.

```cpp
class CountPaths {
public:
    int countPaths(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root, 0);
    }
    
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int count) {
        if (!node) return 0;

        // Toggle the current character's bit in count
        count ^= (1 << (node->val - 'a'));
        
        // If it's a leaf node, check the count of set bits
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            return isPalindrome(count) ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        // Continue DFS for left and right children
        return dfs(node->left, count) + dfs(node->right, count);
    }
    
    bool isPalindrome(int count) {
        // Check if at most one bit is set in count
        return (count & (count - 1)) == 0;
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `count_paths.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `CountPaths` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
