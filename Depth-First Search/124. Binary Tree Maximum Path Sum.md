# **[Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem asks for the maximum path sum in a binary tree, where the path may start and end at any node in the tree. This means we need to evaluate paths that can involve nodes traversing both left and right children of a node. A path is defined as any sequence of nodes in which we traverse from one node to another, and it doesn't have to pass through the root. 

To solve this problem, we can utilize a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree. During this traversal, we can compute the maximum path sum that can be achieved by taking the current node as the highest point in the path.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. **Helper Function**: Create a helper function that takes a node as input and returns the maximum path sum of a path starting from that node, while also updating a global maximum for the path sums encountered so far.
  
2. **Recursive DFS**: In this helper function:
   - If the node is `nullptr`, return `0`.
   - Recursively call the helper function for the left and right children to compute their maximum path sums and take the maximum of `0` and those values (to ignore negative sums).
   - Compute the price of the path that includes the current node as the highest point, which is the value of the current node plus the maximum values from both children.
   - Update a global variable to record the maximum sum found.
   - Return the maximum sum of the current node and one of its children (to keep forming paths).

3. **Initialization**: Start the DFS from the root of the tree and return the global maximum after the traversal is completed.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We traverse each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, which accounts for the recursive stack space used in the DFS.

## **2️⃣ LeetCode Submission**  
```cpp
class BinaryTreeMaximumPathSum {
public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int maxSum = INT_MIN; // Global variable to keep track of maximum path sum
        maxPath(root, maxSum); 
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    int maxPath(TreeNode* node, int& maxSum) {
        if (!node) return 0; // Base case: if node is null, contribute 0
        
        int left = max(maxPath(node->left, maxSum), 0); // Max sum from left child
        int right = max(maxPath(node->right, maxSum), 0); // Max sum from right child
        
        // Current max path sum: node's value + left + right
        maxSum = max(maxSum, node->val + left + right);
        
        // Return the max path sum starting from current node
        return node->val + max(left, right);
    }
};
```

int main() {
    // Example usage: Construct the binary tree 
    TreeNode *root = new TreeNode(-10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(9);
    root->right = new TreeNode(20);
