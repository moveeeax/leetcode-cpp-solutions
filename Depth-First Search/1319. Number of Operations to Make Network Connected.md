# **[Number of Operations to Make Network Connected](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-operations-to-make-network-connected/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem at hand requires understanding a network of computers represented by nodes and edges. Each computer is a node, and the connections (wires) between them are edges. The goal is to determine the number of operations needed to connect all computers. An operation consists of taking a wire from one connection and attaching it to another connection.

To connect `n` computers, we need at least `n - 1` connections (edges). The number of connections we can work with is given directly in the form of edges. If we define the components of the graph, we can see how many more edges we need to make all the separate components of the graph interconnected.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Components**: Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to keep track of connected components. Each time we connect two computers, we union their respective components.
2. **Calculate Components**: Count the number of unique components after processing all edges.
3. **Determine Operations**: The number of operations required to connect these components will be `components - 1`, as we need to connect every remaining component to the main network. Additionally, we check if we have enough edges available to make the connections. If we don't, we return `-1`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(E * Œ±(N)), where E is the number of edges, N is the number of computers, and Œ± is the inverse Ackermann function, which is very slow-growing and can be treated as a constant for all practical purposes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for the parent array in Union-Find.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int makeConnected(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        // If we have fewer connections than computers - 1, it's impossible to connect all.
        if (connections.size() < n - 1) return -1;

        vector<int> parent(n, -1);
        
        // Helper function to find the root parent of a node.
        function<int(int)> find = [&](int node) {
            if (parent[node] == -1) return node; // Node is its own parent.
            return parent[node] = find(parent[node]); // Path compression.
        };

        // Union function to connect nodes.
        auto unionSets = [&](int u, int v) {
            int rootU = find(u);
            int rootV = find(v);
            if (rootU != rootV) {
                parent[rootU] = rootV; // Make one root point to the other.
            }
        };
        
        // Create unions for the given connections.
        for (const auto& conn : connections) {
            unionSets(conn[0], conn[1]);
        }

        // Count the number of components.
        int components = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (parent[i] == -1) components++; // Each -1 indicates a new component.
        }

        // The number of operations needed to connect everything is components - 1.
        return components - 1;
    }
