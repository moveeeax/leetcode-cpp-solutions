# **[Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a directed graph comprised of roads that connect different cities. The goal is to determine the minimum number of roads that need to be reversed so that all paths lead to city 0. In essence, we are looking to find out how many roads are currently pointing away from city 0 that need to be redirected back to it. By understanding the structure of the roads and the directions they currently face, we can calculate the required adjustments efficiently.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle this problem, we will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph. The steps involved in our approach are as follows:

1. **Graph Representation**: We will represent the roads as a graph using an adjacency list. Each road will be represented as a directed edge where the direction matters (some roads point towards city zero while others point away).

2. **Building the Graph**:
   - Create a data structure (like a vector of pairs or an unordered map) to hold the directed edges. Each edge will store both the target city and a flag indicating if the road is directed away from city zero.

3. **DFS Traversal**: Starting from city 0:
   - We will mark nodes as visited to avoid cycles.
   - We will count any road that is directed away from city 0, as these are the roads we need to reverse.
  
4. **Result Calculation**: The total count of roads that need to be reversed will determine the minimum number of operations required to ensure all paths lead to city 0.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of roads (or nodes) as we will traverse each road exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the graph representation in an adjacency list.
