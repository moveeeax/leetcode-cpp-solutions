# **[Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine how many paths from the root to the leaves of a binary tree can be considered "pseudo-palindromic." A path is defined as pseudo-palindromic if the numbers along that path can be rearranged to form a palindrome. For a sequence to be a palindrome, at most one number can occur an odd number of times ‚Äì all others must occur an even number of times. 

This means we need to track the frequency of digits (values) in the paths from the root to each leaf and ensure that there is at most one digit occurring an odd number of times. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We will use DFS to explore each path from the root to the leaves of the tree.
2. **Frequency Count**: As we traverse each path, we will keep a count of how many times each digit has appeared using an array or a hashmap.
3. **Leaf Node Check**: When we reach a leaf node (no left or right children), we will check the frequency count to determine if the path is pseudo-palindromic.
4. **Counting Odd Frequencies**: We will count how many digits have odd frequencies. If this count is at most 1, we increment our result counter.
5. **Backtracking**: As we traverse back up the tree, we will backtrack by decrementing the counts appropriately to maintain accurate frequency counts for the paths being explored.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We traverse each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, used for the recursion stack. The space used for the frequency count array is constant (10 elements for digits 1-9).

        count ^= (1 << node->val);

        // If it's a leaf node
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            // Check if at most one bit is set in count
            return (count & (count - 1)) == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }

        // Continue the DFS traversal
        return dfs(node->left, count) + dfs(node->right, count);
    }
