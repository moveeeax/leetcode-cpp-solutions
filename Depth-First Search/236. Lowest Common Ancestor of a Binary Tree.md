# **[Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree. The LCA is defined as the deepest node that is an ancestor of both nodes. The challenge is to achieve this without altering the structure of the tree or using any additional data structures that would significantly increase space complexity.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we will perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the binary tree. During the traversal:
1. If the current node matches either of the two target nodes (`p` or `q`), we will return the current node.
2. Recursively check the left and right subtrees to see if either subtree contains one of the target nodes.
3. If both left and right subtree checks return a non-null result, it indicates that both nodes are found in different subtrees of the current node; hence, the current node is their LCA.
4. If only one of the subtrees returns a non-null result, we propagate that result up the recursion as it indicates that both nodes are in that subtree.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as we may need to visit each node at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, which could be O(log n) for a balanced tree and O(n) for a skewed tree due to the recursion stack.
