# **[Throne Inheritance](https://leetcode.com/problems/throne-inheritance/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem revolves around simulating a royal inheritance system where each member of the royal family can have children, and we need to determine the order of succession with the ability to mark members as deceased. The root of the succession tree is the king (the first in line), and the children of each member inherit in order of birth unless they are marked deceased.

### **🚀 Approach**  
To implement the throne inheritance system:
1. **Data Structures**: We can use a `map<string, vector<string>>` to represent the family tree, mapping each royal member to their list of children. Additionally, a `set<string>` can keep track of deceased members for constant time lookup.
2. **Methods**: 
   - `birth(string parent, string child)`: Adds a child to the specified parent's list of children.
   - `death(string name)`: Marks a royal member as deceased.
   - `getInheritanceOrder()`: Constructs a list of the royal family in the order they would inherit, omitting any deceased members.

By recursively traversing the tree starting from the root (the king), we append each living member to the inheritance order.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of members since we may need to traverse all members to construct the inheritance order.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the family tree and the set of deceased members.

## **2️⃣ LeetCode Submission**  
```cpp
class ThroneInheritance {
public:
    map<string, vector<string>> familyTree;
    set<string> deceased;
    string king;

    ThroneInheritance(string kingName) {
        king = kingName;
    }

    void birth(string parent, string child) {
        familyTree[parent].push_back(child);
    }

    void death(string name) {
        deceased.insert(name);
    }

    vector<string> getInheritanceOrder() {
        vector<string> order;
        dfs(king, order);
        return order;
    }

private:
    void dfs(string name, vector<string>& order) {
        if (deceased.find(name) == deceased.end()) {
            order.push_back(name);
        }
        for (const string& child : familyTree[name]) {
            dfs(child, order);
        }
    }
};
```

## **3️⃣ Running Locally**  
### **✅ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `ThroneInheritance.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `ThroneInheritance` class** inside `main()` to allow for local testing.  
3. **Include necessary headers** such as `<map>`, `<vector>`, `<set>`, and `<string>`.  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**, possibly using a simple interface to add births and deaths, and then query the inheritance order.  
5. **Compile and run the program**.

    for (const string& name : ti.getInheritanceOrder()) {
        cout << name << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
