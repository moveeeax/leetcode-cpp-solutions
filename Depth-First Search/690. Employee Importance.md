# **[Employee Importance](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-importance/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the total importance of an employee in a company. Each employee has an importance value and may manage other employees, recursively contributing to the overall importance of their team. We need to sum the importance values of an employee and all their subordinates. A depth-first traversal approach is beneficial here since we can explore each employee and their subordinates fully before aggregating the importance values.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: First, we need to represent the employees as a graph where each employee points to their subordinates. This can be achieved using an unordered map, where the key is the employee ID, and the value is a vector of subordinate employee IDs.
  
2. **Recursive Function**: We will define a recursive function that:
   - Takes an employee ID as input.
   - Retrieves this employee's importance.
   - Recursively calls itself for each subordinate, accumulating the total importance.

3. **Memoization**: Since we may visit the same employee multiple times in case of shared subordinates, we will ensure to memoize the employees' importance once it is computed.

4. **Base Case**: The base case for the recursion is when we reach an employee with no subordinates.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of employees. Each employee is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the graph and the recursion stack.

int main() {
    vector<Employee*> employees;
    employees.push_back(new Employee(1, 5, {2, 3}));
    employees.push_back(new Employee(2, 3, {}));
    employees.push_back(new Employee(3, 3, {}));
    
    Solution solution;
    int totalImportance = solution.getImportance(employees, 1);
    cout << "Total Importance of Employee 1: " << totalImportance << endl;

    // Clean up memory
    for (auto emp : employees) {
