# **[Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem at hand is to determine if a given binary tree is height-balanced. A binary tree is considered balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one. The height of a node is defined as the number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf node. 

To solve this problem, we will need to recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees of each node and check the balance condition. If we find any node where the heights of the subtrees differ by more than one, we can conclude that the tree is not balanced.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. **Base Case**: If the node is null, we return a height of 0 indicating that the subtree is balanced by definition.
2. **Recursion**: For each node, we will:
   - Recursively check the left and right children to get their respective heights.
   - Check if the current node is balanced by ensuring the difference in heights is not greater than 1.
3. **Return Value**: The height of the current node will be the maximum height of its two children plus one for the current node itself.
4. **Early Exit**: If at any point we determine that the tree is not balanced, we can stop further checks and return false.

Using this approach, we can efficiently check if the binary tree is balanced in a single traversal.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack, which can go as deep as the height of the tree.

## **2️⃣ LeetCode Submission**  
```cpp
class BalancedBinaryTree {
public:
    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        return height(root) != -1;
    }
    
private:
    int height(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        int leftHeight = height(node->left);
        if (leftHeight == -1) return -1;  // Left subtree is not balanced.
        
        int rightHeight = height(node->right);
        if (rightHeight == -1) return -1;  // Right subtree is not balanced.
        
        if (abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
            return -1;  // Current node is not balanced.
        }
        
        return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;  // Return the height of the subtree.
    }
};
```

## **3️⃣ Running Locally**  
### **✅ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `BalancedBinaryTree.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `BalancedBinaryTree` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class BalancedBinaryTree {
public:
    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        return height(root) != -1;
    }

        int leftHeight = height(node->left);
        if (leftHeight == -1) return -1;  // Left subtree is not balanced.
        
        int rightHeight = height(node->right);
        if (rightHeight == -1) return -1;  // Right subtree is not balanced.
        
        if (abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
            return -1;  // Current node is not balanced.
        }
        
        return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;  // Return the height of the subtree.
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    BalancedBinaryTree solution;

    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(6);

    bool result = solution.isBalanced(root); 
    cout << (result ? "Balanced" : "Not Balanced") << endl;

    // Clean up memory (not shown).
    return 0;
