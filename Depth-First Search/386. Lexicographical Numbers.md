# **[Lexicographical Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographical-numbers/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to generate numbers from 1 to n in lexicographical order. Lexicographical order is similar to dictionary order, where "10" comes before "2" because we compare the digits from left to right. Thus, the goal is to create a list of integers between 1 and n, reordered based on their string representation. For example, if n = 13, the output should be `[1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **DFS (Depth First Search) Strategy**: Since lexicographical order can be generated naturally by exploring numbers, a DFS approach is effective. Starting from the root `1`, explore deeper numbers (e.g., `10`, `11`, ...) until the limit `n` is reached, and then backtrack.
2. **Iterative Generation**: Begin with each digit from `1` to `9`, and for each digit, append `0` to `9` iteratively while ensuring that the resulting number does not exceed `n`.
3. **Result Collection**: A list will gather numbers generated for returning once complete.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) in the most straightforward sense since we are generating and storing at most n numbers. However, since we generate the numbers in a DFS manner, this results in considerably fewer calls than simply iterating through all numbers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the output numbers in a list.
