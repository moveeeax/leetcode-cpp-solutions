# **[Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The key to solving this problem is to realize that the longest path between two nodes can be represented as the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees of a node. By utilizing a depth-first search (DFS) approach, we can effectively calculate both the height of each subtree and the corresponding diameter at each node.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We will implement a recursive function that traverses the tree.
2. **Height Calculation**: For each node, we will calculate the height of its left and right subtrees. The height is defined as the number of edges in the longest path from the node down to a leaf.
3. **Diameter Update**: While we calculate the height, we will also update the diameter based on the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees.
4. **Global Variable**: A class member variable will maintain the maximum diameter found during the traversal, which we will return at the end.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, because we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

## **2️⃣ LeetCode Submission**  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int diameter = 0;
        height(root, diameter);
        return diameter;
    }
    
    int height(TreeNode* node, int& diameter) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        int leftHeight = height(node->left, diameter);
        int rightHeight = height(node->right, diameter);
        diameter = max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);
        return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
};
```
