# **[My Calendar I](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem entails creating a booking system where users can reserve time slots (which are represented as intervals) for an event. Each event is defined by a start and end time, and a crucial requirement is that no two events can overlap. The goal is to implement a data structure that allows for this booking functionality to ensure that when a new event is being booked, it checks against existing booked events for overlaps.

### **🚀 Approach**  
The approach to solve this problem involves using a list to store booked events as intervals. When booking a new event:
1. Check if this new event overlaps with any existing events.
2. An interval [start1, end1] overlaps with another interval [start2, end2] if either:
   - start1 < end2 and start2 < end1
3. By iterating through our list of booked events, we can check for overlaps efficiently.
4. If no overlaps are found, add the event to the list.

For efficient querying, the list of intervals can be kept sorted, allowing for a binary search method to quickly identify possible overlaps.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case for inserting intervals if we do a linear scan. With added optimizations (like keeping intervals sorted), it could approach O(log n) for searches but still requires O(n) for inserts, leading to overall O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to storing the intervals.

```cpp
class MyCalendar {
public:
    vector<pair<int, int>> events;

    MyCalendar() {}

    bool book(int start, int end) {
        for (const auto& event : events) {
            if (max(start, event.first) < min(end, event.second)) {
                return false; // There's an overlap
            }
        }
        events.emplace_back(start, end);
        return true;
    }
};
```

## **3️⃣ Running Locally**  
### **✅ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `MyCalendar.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `MyCalendar` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

        for (const auto& event : events) {
            if (max(start, event.first) < min(end, event.second)) {
                return false; // There's an overlap
            }
        }
        events.emplace_back(start, end);
        return true;
    }

int main() {
    MyCalendar myCalendar;
    // Sample bookings; you can add different bookings to test.
    cout << myCalendar.book(10, 20) << endl; // returns true
    cout << myCalendar.book(15, 25) << endl; // returns false
    cout << myCalendar.book(20, 30) << endl; // returns true
    
    return 0;
