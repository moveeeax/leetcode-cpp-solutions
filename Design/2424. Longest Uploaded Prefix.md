# **[Longest Uploaded Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uploaded-prefix/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around maintaining a count of the longest prefix that has been uploaded based on a given list of uploaded files. Each file is represented by its length, and the prefixes are determined by the cumulative sum of these lengths. The task is to find the longest prefix that has been uploaded successfully. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Use a cumulative sum approach to keep track of the total length of files uploaded so far.
2. Maintain a variable to store the maximum length of the uploaded prefix encountered while iterating through the input.
3. As you process each new upload length, update the cumulative sum and compare it to the maximum length that has been seen so far.
4. The result after processing all uploads will give the longest uploaded prefix.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of uploaded files. We are iterating through the list of uploads only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), we are using a constant amount of additional space for variables.

```cpp
class LongestUploadedPrefix {
public:
    int longestUploadedPrefix(vector<int>& uploadSizes) {
        int max_length = 0;
        int current_length = 0;
        
        for (int size : uploadSizes) {
            current_length += size;
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length);
        }
        
        return max_length;
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `longest_uploaded_prefix.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `LongestUploadedPrefix` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class LongestUploadedPrefix {
public:
    int longestUploadedPrefix(vector<int>& uploadSizes) {
        int max_length = 0;
        int current_length = 0;
        
        for (int size : uploadSizes) {
            current_length += size;
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length);
        }
        
        return max_length;
    }
};

int main() {
    LongestUploadedPrefix solution;
    vector<int> uploadSizes = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int result = solution.longestUploadedPrefix(uploadSizes);
    cout << "Longest Uploaded Prefix: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
