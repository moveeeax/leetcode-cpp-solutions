# **[Exam Room](https://leetcode.com/problems/exam-room/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around a classroom setup where students can choose their seats based on certain distance constraints from each other. The primary goal is to maximize the distance from the nearest occupied seat when a student chooses a seat. The challenge lies in efficiently managing this process, allowing for students to take seats in a manner that maintains this distance maximization across various operations.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structure:** Use a combination of `set` and a variable to keep track of the occupied seats. The `set` will allow us to efficiently find and manage the occupied seats, while also allowing for quick access to the smallest and largest indices of occupied seats.
  
2. **Seat Selection:** To determine the best seat for the next student, iterate through the sorted occupied seats to find:
   - The distance to the first occupied seat (index `0`).
   - The distance between pairs of occupied seats.
   - The distance to the last occupied seat.
   - Keep track of the maximum distance found and the corresponding seat index.

3. **Seat Occupation:** Once the best seat is selected based on calculated distances, update the `set` to include that newly occupied seat.

4. **Reclamation of Seats:** Use a function for students to leave their seats, which simply removes a seat from the `set`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for both the `seat()` and `leave()` operations, where `n` is the number of occupied seats, as we are essentially traversing through the list of currently occupied seats.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) to store the occupied seat indices.

        } else {
            int last_seat = -1; // to handle distance calculation
            for (auto seat : seats) {
                int dist = (seat - last_seat) / 2;

                    max_dist = dist;
                    best_seat = last_seat + dist; // Candidate seat in between
                }
                last_seat = seat; // Update last occupied seat
            }
            // Check distance at the end of the row
            if (N - 1 - last_seat > max_dist) {
                best_seat = N - 1; // Last seat
            }
        }
        
        seats.insert(best_seat);
        return best_seat;

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `exam_room.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `ExamRoom` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
