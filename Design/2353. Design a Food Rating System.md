# **[Design a Food Rating System](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-food-rating-system/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem entails designing a system to manage a food rating system with several operations. First, we need to be able to add food items with their corresponding ratings, and then allow updating the food ratings and obtaining the highest rated food item. The challenge is to ensure that the operations can be performed efficiently, minimizing the time taken for frequent queries while keeping the system updated with the latest ratings.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To efficiently handle food ratings and queries, we can utilize a combination of a `map` and a `set`. 
- We will use a `map<string, int>` to keep track of each food item and its rating. 
- A `map<int, set<string>>` will be used to maintain ratings as keys, with food items as values. This allows us to quickly access food items by rating.

Key operations:
1. **Add Food**: Insert a food item with its initial rating into both maps.
2. **Change Rating**: When a rating is updated, we will:
   - Remove the food item from its current rating.
   - Insert it into the new rating effectively.
3. **Retrieve Highest Rated Food**: Simply access the last element of the highest rating set.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) for insertions and deletions, where n is the number of food items due to the nature of `set` and `map` operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) to store the food items and their ratings.

```cpp
class FoodRatings {
public:
    // Mapping of food name to its rating
    unordered_map<string, int> foodRatings; 
    // Mapping of ratings to the food items with that rating
    map<int, set<string>> ratings; 
    
    FoodRatings(vector<string>& foods, vector<int>& ratingsList) {
        for (int i = 0; i < foods.size(); ++i) {
            foodRatings[foods[i]] = ratingsList[i];
            ratings[ratingsList[i]].insert(foods[i]);
        }
    }
    
    void changeRating(string food, int newRating) {
        int oldRating = foodRatings[food];
        
        // Remove food from old rating
        ratings[oldRating].erase(food);
        if (ratings[oldRating].empty()) {
            ratings.erase(oldRating);
        }
        
        // Update the food rating
        foodRatings[food] = newRating;
        ratings[newRating].insert(food);
    }
    
    string highestRated() {
        return *ratings.rbegin()->second.begin(); // Get the food with the highest rating
    }
};
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `FoodRatingSystem.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `FoodRatings` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class FoodRatings {
public:
    unordered_map<string, int> foodRatings; 
    map<int, set<string>> ratings; 
    
    FoodRatings(vector<string>& foods, vector<int>& ratingsList) {
        for (int i = 0; i < foods.size(); ++i) {
            foodRatings[foods[i]] = ratingsList[i];
            ratings[ratingsList[i]].insert(foods[i]);
        }
    }
    
    void changeRating(string food, int newRating) {
        int oldRating = foodRatings[food];
        ratings[oldRating].erase(food);
        if (ratings[oldRating].empty()) {
            ratings.erase(oldRating);
        }
        foodRatings[food] = newRating;
        ratings[newRating].insert(food);
    }
    
    string highestRated() {
        return *ratings.rbegin()->second.begin(); 
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<string> foods = {"burger", "pizza", "salad"};
    vector<int> ratingsList = {5, 4, 3};
    
    FoodRatings foodRatings(foods, ratingsList);
    cout << foodRatings.highestRated() << endl;  // Outputs: burger
    foodRatings.changeRating("pizza", 6);
    cout << foodRatings.highestRated() << endl;  // Outputs: pizza

    return 0;
}
```
