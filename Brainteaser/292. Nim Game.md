# **[Nim Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The Nim Game is a two-player game where players take turns removing objects from piles. The player who cannot make a move (there are no objects left) loses the game. The objective is to determine if the first player has a winning strategy given the initial conditions of the piles. 

The game's essence can be captured by analyzing the winning and losing positions using the concept of Nim-sum, which is the bitwise XOR of the sizes of all the piles. If the Nim-sum is zero at a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if both play optimally. Conversely, if it's non-zero, the player has a winning strategy.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Compute the Nim-sum**: Calculate the bitwise XOR of the sizes of all piles. This represents the state of the game.
2. **Determine the outcome based on the Nim-sum**:
   - If the result of the Nim-sum (i.e., `heap1 ^ heap2 ^ ... ^ heapN`) is zero, the first player will lose if the second player plays optimally. Thus, return false.
   - If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player can force a win by making a move that results in a zero Nim-sum for the second player, so return true.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of piles, since we traverse the list of piles to compute the Nim-sum.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no additional space is used apart from a few variables.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `nim_game.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `NimGame` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

};

int main() {
    NimGame game;
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of stones in the pile: ";
    cin >> n;
    if (game.canWinNim(n)) {
        cout << "First player can win." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "First player cannot win." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
