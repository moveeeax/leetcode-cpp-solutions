# **[Bulb Switcher](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around a series of light bulbs that can either be on or off. All bulbs start in the off position. There are `n` bulbs, and you perform a sequence of switch operations. Specifically, for each `i` from 1 to `n`, you toggle the state (on/off) of every `i`-th bulb. The goal is to determine how many bulbs remain on after performing the operations.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem efficiently, we need to deduce how many bulbs remain on after the complete sequence of operations:
1. Each bulb changes its state whenever it is toggled.
2. A bulb at position `k` is toggled every time `k` is a multiple of `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`).
3. The total number of times a bulb is toggled corresponds to the number of its divisors: if a bulb's position has an even number of divisors, it remains off; if it has an odd number, it remains on.
4. Only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors (since a divisor pairs up, except for the square root that is counted once).
5. Thus, the number of bulbs that remain on is equal to the count of perfect squares less than or equal to `n`, which is simply the largest integer `x` such that `x^2 ‚â§ n`. This can be calculated as `floor(sqrt(n))`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) because only a square root calculation and a flooring operation are required.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we only use a fixed amount of extra space.
