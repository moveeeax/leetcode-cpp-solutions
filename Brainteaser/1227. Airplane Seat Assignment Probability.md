# **[Airplane Seat Assignment Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/airplane-seat-assignment-probability/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem revolves around calculating the probability that a specific passenger (the last one, in this case) ends up sitting in their assigned seat when all the passengers board an airplane randomly. The airplane has two rows of three seats each (A, B, C and D, E, F), with the first passenger potentially taking any seat instead of their assigned one due to randomness. Depending on this choice, the seating arrangement can significantly alter the chances of the remaining passengers getting their correct seats.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. The first passenger can either:
   - Sit in his/her assigned seat (A), which guarantees everyone else will seat correctly. This happens once.
   - Sit in seat D, E, or F (the last seat). This may lead to disarray since the last passenger cannot sit in the correct seat if the first passenger occupies it.
   
2. On subsequent boarding, if a passenger finds their assigned seat taken, they too must sit at random in one of the remaining seats. The crucial insight here is that the last passenger's fate is tethered to whether their assigned seat remains unoccupied until their turn.
   
3. After analyzing the various cases and their outcomes, we discover that if the first passenger does not sit in their seat (seat A), it reduces the randomness around the last passenger to a deterministic situation: they would have a 50-50 chance of either sitting in their correct seat or the first passenger's seat.

4. Thus, the final answer can be expressed in a straightforward way based on the index (n=1) for a single flight.

        return n == 1 ? 1.0 : 0.5;
    }
};

int main() {
    AirplaneSeatAssignmentProbability solution;
    int n;

    cout << "Enter the number of passengers: ";
    cin >> n;

    double result = solution.nthPersonGetsNthSeat(n);
    cout << "Probability that the last passenger sits in their assigned seat: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}  
```
