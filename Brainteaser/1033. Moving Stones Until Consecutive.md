# **[Moving Stones Until Consecutive](https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-stones-until-consecutive/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining how many moves are required to make all stones represent consecutive positions on a number line. The stones are represented as distinct positions in an array. The goal is to optimally sort these positions to minimize the number of moves while ensuring that the final positions are consecutive. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding Moves**: 
   - Each move allows a stone to be shifted by one position to the left or right.
   - To make all stones consecutive, we need to find the range that needs to be transformed into a consecutive sequence.

2. **Sorting the Positions**: 
   - First, sort the stone positions. This helps in determining the minimum and maximum stones.

3. **Determining the Range**:
   - The ideal final consecutive position for stones would stretch from the smallest position to the largest position in the sorted array.
   - If we have `n` stones, the required number of consecutive positions is from the minimum position to the minimum position + (n - 1).

4. **Calculating Moves**:
   - If the current maximum position minus the minimum position is less than `n`, the stones can already be made consecutive with some moves.
   - Specifically, calculate the number of moves needed to fill gaps and consider that the minimum number of moves will directly relate to how many stones do not fit in the ideal consecutive range.

5. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If all stones are already in consecutive positions, then no moves are needed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - due to sorting the input positions.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - only a few extra variables are used.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numMovesStonesII(vector<int>& stones) {
        sort(stones.begin(), stones.end());
        int n = stones.size();
        int min_moves = min(stones[n - 1] - stones[0] + 1 - n, 2); // min must be at least 2 if all stones are distinct
        // Two conditions for the case:
        // If stones are already consecutive or need little adjustment
        if (stones[0] == stones[1] - 1 && stones[n - 1] == stones[n - 2] + 1) {
            min_moves = 0;
        }
        // Adjust min_moves if there are only one empty space present in end
        if (stones[0] == 1 && stones[n - 1] - stones[n - 2] == 1) min_moves = 1; 
        
        int max_moves = n - 1; // Moving all outer stones to maximum range

        return {min_moves, max_moves};
