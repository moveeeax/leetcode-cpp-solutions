# **[Divisor Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The Divisor Game is a two-player game where players take turns choosing a positive integer \( x \) such that \( 0 < x < N \) and \( N \) is divisible by \( x \). The player who cannot make a move (because there are no valid divisors left) loses the game. The game is played with an initial value \( N \), and we need to determine if the first player has a winning strategy, assuming both players play optimally.

The intuition here revolves around recognizing patterns or understanding the concept of winning and losing positions. If a player can force the opponent into a losing position on their next turn, then they are guaranteed to win.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The key insight into this problem lies in analyzing the states of \( N \) and determining which states are winning (W) and losing (L). Through observation, we can derive the following:
- If \( N \) is even, the first player can always subtract 1 (an allowed move), which makes \( N \) odd for the second player. Thus, the first player can force the opponent into a losing state.
- Conversely, if \( N \) is odd, whatever move the first player makes will result in an even \( N \) for the second player, allowing the second player to force the first player back into an odd state.

Thus, the strategy can be simplified to recognizing that:
- The first player wins if \( N \) is even.
- The first player loses if \( N \) is odd.

This gives us a very straightforward solution.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), since we're only checking whether \( N \) is even or odd.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using constant space.
