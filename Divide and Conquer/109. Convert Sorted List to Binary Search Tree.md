# **[Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem requires us to convert a sorted linked list into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST). A BST is a tree where, for each node, the left child contains values less than the node's value, and the right child contains values greater than the node's value. A height-balanced BST ensures that the depths of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than one.

Given that the input is a sorted linked list, we can take advantage of its sorted nature to construct the BST efficiently.

### **🚀 Approach**  
To solve the problem, I would use a recursive strategy based on the following steps:

1. **Find the Middle Element**: We can use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle element of the linked list which will become the root of the BST. 
   - The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

2. **Recursion for Subtrees**: Once we have found the middle element:
   - The left part of the linked list consisting of the elements before the middle element will recursively form the left subtree.
   - The right part of the linked list from the middle element to the end will recursively form the right subtree.

3. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when there are no elements left (i.e., the sublist is null).

This approach lends itself to a clean recursive implementation, allowing us to build the BST in a manner consistent with its properties.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the linked list. Each element is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n), which is the space required for the recursive call stack, since the height of the resulting BST is O(log n) in a balanced tree.

            prev = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        prev->next = nullptr; // Split the list into two halves
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(slow->val);
        root->left = sortedListToBST(head);
        root->right = sortedListToBST(slow->next);
        
        return root;
    }
};

    int val;

        if (!head->next) return new TreeNode(head->val);

        ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head, *prev = nullptr;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        prev->next = nullptr; // Split the list into two halves
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(slow->val);
        root->left = sortedListToBST(head);
        root->right = sortedListToBST(slow->next);
        
        return root;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    // Create a sorted linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(1);
    head->next = new ListNode(2);
    head->next->next = new ListNode(3);
    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(4);
    head->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(5);
    
    TreeNode* root = solution.sortedListToBST(head);

    // Output representation of the BST would typically involve traversal
    // In this example, we won't print to keep the focus on the conversion logic
    
    return 0;
