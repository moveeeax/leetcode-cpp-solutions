# **[Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of '1' bits (also known as set bits) in the binary representation of a given unsigned integer. This is a common task in computer science, particularly in operations related to bit manipulation. The core idea revolves around converting an integer to its binary format and then counting how many times '1' appears.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To efficiently count the number of '1' bits in an unsigned integer, we can utilize a technique known as Brian Kernighan's algorithm. This method works by iteratively canceling the least significant '1' bit of the number until the number becomes zero. Each cancellation operation represents one '1' bit that has been counted.

Here are the steps involved in the approach:
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of '1' bits.
2. While the integer `n` is greater than 0, perform the following:
   - Increment the `count` by 1.
   - Use the bitwise AND operation with `n` and `n-1`, which turns off the rightmost '1' bit in `n`.
3. Repeat the process until `n` becomes zero.
4. The final count will be the total number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the integer.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of '1' bits in the integer.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
