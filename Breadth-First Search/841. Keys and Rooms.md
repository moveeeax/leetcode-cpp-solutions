# **[Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem presents a scenario where we have a collection of rooms, each containing a set of keys that open other rooms. The goal is to determine if we can visit all the rooms starting from room 0. This problem can be visualized as a graph traversal problem, where rooms are nodes, and keys represent directed edges leading to other nodes (rooms). 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - The rooms can be represented as a graph where each room is a node and each key allows traversal to the corresponding room. Each room contains the keys to other rooms.

2. **Graph Traversal**:
   - We can utilize Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the graph. Starting from room 0, we will visit all reachable rooms and keep track of these rooms.

3. **Visited Rooms**:
   - Use a boolean array to mark rooms as visited. Initially, only room 0 is visited. As we find keys to new rooms, we will mark them as visited and explore them.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - At the end of the traversal, check if the total number of visited rooms equals the total number of rooms. If they match, then it is possible to visit all rooms.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + E), where N is the number of rooms and E is the total number of keys available. Each room is visited once, and each key is checked once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the maximum number of rooms stored in the visitation state.

                    s.push(key); // Add new room to stack for further exploration
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check if all rooms have been visited
        for (bool visit : visited) {
            if (!visit) return false; // If any room is unvisited, return false
        }
        
        return true; // All rooms are visited
    }
