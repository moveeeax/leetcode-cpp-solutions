# **[Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance I](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-houses-at-a-certain-distance-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is focused on counting the number of houses at a specific distance from a given starting point. The input consists of a list of houses represented by an integer array, where each element indicates the position of a house along a number line. We also have a starting point and a distance, and the goal is to determine how many houses lie within the specified distance from the starting point.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem effectively:
1. **Input Reading**: Parse the input to retrieve the list of house positions, the starting position, and the required distance.
2. **Distance Calculation**: Utilize the distance provided to establish a range of positions (from `start - distance` to `start + distance`).
3. **Counting Houses**: Traverse through the list of houses and count how many of them fall within the calculated range.
4. **Output the Result**: Return the count of houses that are within the specified distance.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of houses; we need to iterate through the list of houses to count them.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

        int upperBound = start + distance;

        for (int position : houses) {
            if (position >= lowerBound && position <= upperBound) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
