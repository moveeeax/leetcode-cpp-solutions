# **[Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem requires us to connect each node's right pointer to its next right node in a binary tree. If there is no next right node, the right pointer should be set to `nullptr`. The key distinction here is that this tree is not guaranteed to be a complete binary tree, which means nodes can be missing at various levels.

### **🚀 Approach**  
To solve this problem optimally, we can use a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal) of the tree. We'll utilize a queue to keep track of nodes at the current level and establish connections to their right neighbors. Since we're dealing with a non-complete binary tree, we can't just rely on the child nodes being in a straightforward order, hence the need for a queue.

1. We will initialize a queue and start with the root node.
2. For each level, we will keep track of the previously processed node on that level to create the right connections.
3. As we dequeue nodes, we will enqueue their children, ensuring we process left children before right children to maintain the correct order of connection.
4. Once all nodes at the current level are processed, we will connect their right pointers appropriately.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree, because in a level-order traversal we may be storing multiple nodes at the same time in the queue.
