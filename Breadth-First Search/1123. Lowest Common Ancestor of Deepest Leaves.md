# **[Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is asking us to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the deepest leaves in a binary tree. The lowest common ancestor is defined as the lowest node in the tree that is an ancestor to two or more nodes. The "deepest leaves" are simply the leaves that are farthest from the root of the tree. To solve this, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find the depth of each leaf while simultaneously tracking the nodes at the deepest level.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Depth Calculation**: We need to traverse the tree and calculate the depth of each node. While traversing, we can also keep track of which nodes are the leaves.
2. **Tracking Nodes**: As we check each node during the DFS, if a node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children) and at the deepest level, we will add it to a specialized data structure for tracking.
3. **Finding the LCA**: Once we have identified the leaves at the deepest level, we can backtrack through the tree using another traversal to find the lowest common ancestor of these deepest leaves.
4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the node that is the lowest common ancestor of the deepest leaves.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since we're visiting each node once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to recursive function call stack space.
