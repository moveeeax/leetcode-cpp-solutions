# **[Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a directed graph represented by an adjacency list, where nodes (or states) can lead to other nodes. Certain nodes are "eventually safe" if they can only reach nodes that are also safe. If we follow the directed paths from a node, it will eventually lead to a cycle or a terminal node. The goal is to identify all the nodes that are eventually safe states, meaning they do not lead to a cycle of unsafe states.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we will utilize Depth-First Search (DFS). The main steps of the approach include:

1. **Graph Representation**: We will model the states and transitions as a directed graph using an adjacency list.
2. **State Tracking**: We will maintain three states for each node:
   - **0**: Unvisited
   - **1**: Visiting (part of the current path in DFS)
   - **2**: Safe (the node can eventually lead to terminal states).
3. **DFS for Safety Check**: We will apply DFS starting from each node:
   - If we reach a node that is already in process (state 1), it indicates a cycle, and we can mark this node as unsafe.
   - If we reach a node that is safe (state 2), propagate this state back to the previous nodes.
4. **Result Compilation**: Finally, we will collect all nodes that have been marked as safe.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This accounts for the time needed for traversing each node and edge.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), for the storage of the state of each node.
