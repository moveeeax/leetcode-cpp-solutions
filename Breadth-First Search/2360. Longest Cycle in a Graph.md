# **[Longest Cycle in a Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-cycle-in-a-graph/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about finding the longest cycle in a directed graph represented by an array `edges` where `edges[i]` is the node that node `i` points to. If a node does not point to any node, it is represented by `-1`. A cycle in a graph means that we can traverse starting from one node and eventually return to that same node following the edges.

To solve the problem, we will use depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph from each unvisited node. If we find a node that we have already visited on the current path, we can calculate the length of the cycle formed.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Utilize a visited array to keep track of the status of each node: unvisited, visiting, or visited. Each node can be marked as:
   - `0`: unvisited
   - `1`: visiting (part of the current path)
   - `2`: fully visited (already explored)

2. **DFS Function**:
   - For each unvisited node, start a DFS.
   - Mark the current node as `visiting`.
   - If you encounter a node that is already `visiting`, that indicates a cycle. Calculate the cycle length by traversing back to the start of the cycle.
   - Once done, mark the node as fully visited.

3. **Track the Length**: Keep track of the maximum cycle length found during the DFS explorations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes, since each node and edge is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the visited array and the recursion stack in the worst case.
