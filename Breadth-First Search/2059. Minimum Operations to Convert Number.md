# **[Minimum Operations to Convert Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-convert-number/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations needed to convert a source number (`start`) to a target number (`target`). We can use three types of operations: incrementing the number, halving the number if it's even, or doubling it. 

To solve this problem, we can think of it as a breadth-first search (BFS) problem on a number line where each number can be reached by applying one of the three operations. With BFS, we can efficiently explore possible transitions and determine the fewest moves to reach the `target`.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. **BFS Initialization**: We initiate BFS from the `start` number, tracking how many operations have been performed.
2. **Queue Usage**: We utilize a queue to explore each valid state (current number). This allows us to examine numbers in the order of their distance from the `start`.
3. **End Condition**: The search continues until we reach the `target` number, at which point we return the count of operations taken.
4. **Visited Set**: To avoid processing the same number multiple times and thus prevent infinite loops, we keep a set of visited numbers.
5. **Operations**: For each number, we apply the three operations:
   - Increment by 1
   - Halve (if even)
   - Double
6. **Bounds Check**: Additionally, we should ensure we don't explore numbers beyond reasonable bounds since negative numbers or overly large numbers may not be helpful.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the maximum operational distance from `start` to `target`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the queue and the visited set.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(int start, int target) {
        if (start >= target) return start - target;

        queue<int> q;
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        q.push(start);
        visited.insert(start);
        int operations = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                int current = q.front();
                q.pop();

                if (current == target) return operations;

                // Possible operations
                int next_ops[] = {current + 1, current * 2};
                for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
                    if (next_ops[j] <= 2 * target && visited.find(next_ops[j]) == visited.end()) {
                        visited.insert(next_ops[j]);
                        q.push(next_ops[j]);
                    }
                }

                if (current % 2 == 0) {
                    int half = current / 2;
                    if (visited.find(half) == visited.end()) {
                        visited.insert(half);
                        q.push(half);
                    }
                }
            }
            operations++;
        }
        return -1; // Just to satisfy return type, shouldn't happen with valid input
    }
};  
```

## **3️⃣ Running Locally**  
### **✅ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `minimum_operations.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
