# **[Minimum Number of Operations to Make X and Y Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-x-and-y-equal/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations to make two numbers equal. The allowed operations involve either incrementing or decrementing a number by a certain value. Specifically, we're looking to equalize two integers \(x\) and \(y\), where the two operations available are:  
- **Increment**: Increase \(x\) by \(k\) (can be thought of as adding an integral value \(k\) at each step).
- **Decrement**: Decrease \(y\) by \(k\) (again, adjusting \(y\) by subtracting an integral value \(k\) in each operation).

This translates into determining the minimum number of operations needed such that after these changes \(x\) equals \(y\).

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify the Difference**: First, we compute the absolute difference \(d = |x - y|\). This represents how far apart the two numbers are.
2. **Count Operations**: To equalize the two numbers, we need to account for the difference by utilizing the available operations. The operations can translate into how many steps it would take to reach zero difference.
3. **Determine the Result**: If \(d\) is zero, then no operations are required. If \(d > 0\), one operation would always reduce the difference by \(1\). Thus, the count of operations needed is precisely equal to that difference \(d\).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) since we perform a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as no additional data structures are utilized that scale with input size.

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> // for abs function

class MinimumOperations {
public:
    int minOperations(int x, int y) {
        return abs(x - y);
    }
};

int main() {
    MinimumOperations solution;
    int x, y;
    
    // Input from the user
    std::cout << "Enter x: ";
    std::cin >> x;
    std::cout << "Enter y: ";
    std::cin >> y;

    int result = solution.minOperations(x, y);
    
    std::cout << "Minimum operations to make " << x << " and " << y << " equal: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
