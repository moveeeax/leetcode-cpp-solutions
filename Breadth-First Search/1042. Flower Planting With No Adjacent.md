# **[Flower Planting With No Adjacent](https://leetcode.com/problems/flower-planting-with-no-adjacent/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to plant different types of flowers in a linear garden such that no two adjacent houses have the same type of flower. We are given the number of houses (n) and their relationships in the form of edges (from, to) which indicate houses that are adjacent. Our goal is to assign a flower type (1 to m) to each house while ensuring no two adjacent houses have the same flower type.  

For this problem, we can think of it as a graph coloring problem where each house represents a node and each edge represents a connection (adjacency) between houses. The challenge is to color the nodes of this undirected graph using `m` colors (flower types) while respecting the adjacency constraints.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: We'll represent the garden as an undirected graph using an adjacency list since it allows easy traversal of neighbors.
2. **DFS/BFS Coloring**: We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse through each house. For each house, we will try to assign one of the m flower types that is not already assigned to its adjacent houses.
3. **Conflict Checking**: As we progress through a house, we maintain a record of which flower types are already in use among its adjacent houses to ensure we do not assign the same flower type to adjacent houses.
4. **Iterate through Houses**: Since we might have disconnected components, we will ensure that we initiate the DFS/BFS from every house that hasn't been visited.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + p) where n is the number of houses and p is the number of adjacency relationships (edges). We visit each house and check its neighbors.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + p) for storing the adjacency list representation of the garden.
