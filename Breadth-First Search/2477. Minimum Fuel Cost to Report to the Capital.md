# **[Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-fuel-cost-to-report-to-the-capital/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around a tree structure where nodes represent cities and edges represent roads connecting these cities. Each city has a population. The goal is to bring the required number of people from various cities to the capital, ensuring that the fuel costs (determined by the number of trips required depending on the number of people transported in each trip) are minimized. 

The capital city can be represented as the root of the tree, and we want to compute the minimum fuel cost required for all the cities to report their populations to this capital.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Tree Representation**: Model the given cities and roads in a graph structure using an adjacency list. This will help in traversing the tree effectively.
   
2. **DFS Traversal**: Use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree from the capital downwards. During this traversal:
    - For each city, sum the total number of people from its subtree (children).
    - Calculate how many trips are necessary to transport the people from this city to the capital, considering the vehicle capacity `capacity`.
    
3. **Fuel Calculation**: Each trip can carry up to `capacity` people. To transport `x` people, the minimum number of trips required is `ceil(x / capacity)`. This ensures we account for transporting all the people.

4. **Accumulate Costs**: Accumulate the total fuel cost (i.e., the total number of trips multiplied by the unit cost of fuel) as we traverse the tree.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of cities (nodes) since each city is visited once in the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the adjacency list.
