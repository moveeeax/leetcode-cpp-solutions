# **[The Time When the Network Becomes Idle](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-time-when-the-network-becomes-idle/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem concerns a network of nodes where each node has tasks to complete, and there's a need to understand when the entire network will finish processing its tasks and become idle. Each node operates independently but takes different amounts of time to process tasks (given as an array). Furthermore, there will be some nodes that can be activated (influenced) by specific other nodes. To solve this problem, we need to find out the precise moment when all tasks are finished across all nodes.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem effectively, we can use the following steps:
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the network using a directed graph where each node points to the nodes it can activate. 
2. **Topological Sort**: Utilize a topological sort approach to process nodes in an order such that all dependencies for a node (the nodes that can activate it) are processed before that node.
3. **Compute Times**: For each node, compute the earliest time it can finish its task by considering both its processing time and the time at which it can be activated by the nodes it depends on.
4. **Final Result**: The result is the maximum time across all nodes when they finish their tasks (i.e., the last node to become idle).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges (the activations). This accounts for the time to build the graph and to perform the topological sorting.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for storing the graph and the array used for in-degrees.
