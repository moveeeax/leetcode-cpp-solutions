# **[Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-after-road-addition-queries-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to determine the shortest distance between pairs of nodes in a tree (which is defined as a graph with no cycles) after some additional roads (edges) are added between nodes. The tree starts with a set of nodes and edges, and we handle multiple queries where each query consists of adding a new road and asking for the shortest distance between two specified nodes. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Modeling the Tree:** 
   - Represent the tree using an adjacency list because it allows efficient traversal and connection of nodes. Each node will have a list of its connected neighbors.
   
2. **Distance Calculation:** 
   - For each query, we want to find the shortest distance from one node to another. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the shortest paths in the tree structure. However, doing this for every query could become inefficient.

3. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU):**
   - To efficiently manage the addition of roads and update the connectivity between nodes, we can use the Union-Find data structure. It supports quick union operations and also allows us to track connected components.
   
4. **Answer Queries:**
   - For each query, add the edge to the union-find structure. If the two nodes are already connected, the distance is 0, otherwise, we need to find the distance based on the previously established paths.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(q * (m + n * Œ±(n))) where `q` is the number of queries, `m` is the number of edges in the initial tree, `n` is the number of nodes, and Œ±(n) is the inverse Ackermann function which grows very slowly, making the amortized time per union/find operations nearly constant.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the union-find data structure and the adjacency list.
