# **[Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is defined as the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node. A leaf node is one that does not have any children. The solution needs to traverse the tree structure while keeping track of the depth reached at each node.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS inherently explores nodes level by level, making it a suitable choice for finding the shortest path in terms of depth. The algorithm will proceed as follows:

1. **Queue Initialization**: Use a queue to facilitate BFS. Start by adding the root node and its depth (1) to the queue.
2. **BFS Traversal**: While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element and check if it is a leaf node (both left and right children are null).
3. **Leaf Node Check**: If a leaf node is encountered, we record the depth and return it as it is the minimum depth.
4. **Queue Updates**: If the current node is not a leaf, enqueue its non-null children along with their respective depth (current depth + 1).
5. **Termination**: The process continues until a leaf node is found, ensuring the first one encountered is the minimum depth due to the nature of BFS.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We may need to traverse all nodes in the worst case.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree. This space complexity arises from the queue used for BFS, storing the nodes at each level.

                return depth; // Return the current depth as it's the minimum depth.
            }
            
            // If left child exists, add it to the queue.
            if (node->left) {
                q.push({node->left, depth + 1});
            }

            if (node->right) {
                q.push({node->right, depth + 1});
            }
        }
        
        return 0; // This line is theoretically unreachable due to the leaf check above.
    }
