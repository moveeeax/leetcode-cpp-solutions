# **[Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem revolves around finding the minimum difference between values of any two nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST). A BST has the property that for any given node, all values in its left subtree are smaller and values in its right subtree are larger. This allows us to perform an in-order traversal to obtain a sorted list of values.

### **🚀 Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize an in-order traversal of the BST. During this traversal, we keep track of the previous value we encountered. The difference between the current node's value and the previous value gives us the potential minimum distance. The goal is to update the minimum distance whenever we visit a node.

1. Perform an in-order traversal (left-root-right):
   - If the current node has a left child, we traverse to the left child.
   - When we visit a node, we compute the difference between the current node's value and the previous node's value (if it exists).
   - Update the minimum distance if the computed difference is smaller.
   - Set the current node's value as the previous value and traverse right.

2. Continue this traversal until all nodes have been visited.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST since we visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the BST; this is due to the recursive call stack during the in-order traversal. In the worst case, it could be O(n) for a skewed tree.
