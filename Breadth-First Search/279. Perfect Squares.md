# **[Perfect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is to find the minimum number of perfect square numbers that sum up to a given positive integer `n`. A perfect square number is an integer that is the square of an integer (like `1`, `4`, `9`, `16`, etc.). The challenge lies in efficiently determining how many such squares are needed to sum to `n`, without having to check every possible combination.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to `i`. 

1. **Initialization**: Start by defining `dp[0] = 0` because zero can be made with zero squares. For any integer from `1` to `n`, initialize `dp[i]` to infinity (or a large number) since we want to minimize this value.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: For each integer `i` from `1` to `n`, we will iteratively check all perfect squares less than or equal to `i`. For each perfect square `j*j` (where `j` is such that `j*j <= i`), we can attempt to update `dp[i]` with the formula:
   \[
   dp[i] = \min(dp[i], dp[i - j*j] + 1)
   \]
   This represents choosing one square `j*j` and adding it to the minimum count required for the remaining value `i - j*j`.

3. **Result**: Finally, the value at `dp[n]` will represent the minimum number of perfect square numbers that sum up to `n`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * ‚àön), due to iterating through all numbers up to `n` and checking all perfect squares up to each `i`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we use an array of size `n + 1`.

                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1);
            }
