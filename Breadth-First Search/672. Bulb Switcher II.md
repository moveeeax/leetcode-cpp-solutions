# **[Bulb Switcher II](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem presents a scenario where multiple bulbs can be toggled on or off based on a given number of presses. Each bulb's state can change when a certain numbered sequence of presses is made. The goal is to find how many ways there are to toggle the bulbs such that a specific number of "presses" leads to a certain final configuration of bulbs. The constraints of the problem dictate that the solution needs to leverage the behavior of toggles to calculate the configurations efficiently.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we would utilize a combinatorial approach to count the possible configurations of bulbs. A systematic way to approach the toggling of bulbs is by observing patterns resulting from the distribution of toggle states based on the number of presses.

1. **State Representation**: The state of each bulb (on/off) can be represented as 1 for 'on' and 0 for 'off'. Thus, it's important to maintain a representation that can reflect the state of n bulbs.
  
2. **Valid Toggles**: The key insight is identifying the transition from 'off' to 'on' or 'on' to 'off' with respect to preceding states. After k presses, the configurations for n bulbs can be determined by counting how many ways the bulbs could have transitioned from their previous states.
  
3. **Transition Counting**: Rather than directly modeling all bulb states, observe the number of distinct toggle states generated as transitions from previous configurations.

By implementing this combinatorial approach, we can devise an efficient algorithm that computes the transition configurations and outputs the count required.
