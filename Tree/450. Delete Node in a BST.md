# **[Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to delete a node from a binary search tree (BST). A BST is structured such that for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree are smaller, and all nodes in its right subtree are larger. Deleting a node can involve three scenarios:  

1. The node to be deleted is a leaf (no children).
2. The node to be deleted has one child.
3. The node to be deleted has two children.

In cases one and two, the node can be removed directly or replaced with its child. In the third case, we need to find a replacement node, which can typically be done by finding the node's in-order predecessor (the largest node in its left subtree) or in-order successor (the smallest node in its right subtree). The general structure of the BST remains intact after the deletion, maintaining the BST properties.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To implement the deletion, we can use a recursive helper function that will take the current node and value of the node to be deleted:

1. If the current node is `nullptr`, return `nullptr` (base case).
2. If the value to delete is less than the current node's value, recursively attempt to delete on the left subtree.
3. If the value to delete is greater than the current node's value, recursively attempt to delete on the right subtree.
4. If the current node's value matches the value to be deleted, we handle the three cases:
   - If the node is a leaf, just return `nullptr`.
   - If the node has one child, return that child.
   - If the node has two children, find the in-order successor, replace the current node's value with the successor's value, and then recursively delete the successor.

This approach is efficient and ensures that all operations are performed recursively.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(h) where h is the height of the tree (in the worst case O(n) for an unbalanced tree).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) due to recursion stack space (again O(n) in the worst case for an unbalanced tree).
