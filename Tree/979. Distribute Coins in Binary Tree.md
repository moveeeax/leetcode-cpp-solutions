# **[Distribute Coins in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem involves distributing coins in a binary tree such that each node must have exactly one coin. We need to count the number of moves required to accomplish this. A move involves transferring a coin from one node to a child node. The goal is to minimize the total number of moves made.  

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. **Tree Traversal**: We will need to traverse the binary tree, which we can do using Depth-First Search (DFS). As we traverse, we will calculate the excess or deficit of coins at each node.
2. **Calculate Moves**: For each node, we will keep track of the surplus or deficit of coins relative to what it should have. If a node has more coins than needed, we can transfer the excess coins down to its children. If a node has fewer coins, it means it will require moves from its parent or siblings.
3. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that will return the total number of moves required for each subtree while simultaneously calculating the balance of coins at that node.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree (since we visit each node once).
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree (due to the recursion stack).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int moves = 0;

    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root);
        return moves;
    }

    int dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return 0;

        int balance = node->val + dfs(node->left) + dfs(node->right) - 1;
        moves += abs(balance);
        return balance;
    }
};
```

## **📝 Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int moves = 0;

    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root);
        return moves;
    }

    int dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return 0;

        int balance = node->val + dfs(node->left) + dfs(node->right) - 1;
        moves += abs(balance);
        return balance;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;

    // Constructing the binary tree manually for the local run
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left = new TreeNode(0);
    root->right = new TreeNode(0);

    // Example run
    cout << "Number of moves required: " << solution.distributeCoins(root) << endl;

    // Clean up
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```
