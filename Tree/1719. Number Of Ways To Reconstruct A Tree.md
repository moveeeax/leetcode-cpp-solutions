# **[Number Of Ways To Reconstruct A Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reconstruct-a-tree/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the number of ways to reconstruct a tree based on the provided parent-child relationships. We are given two lists of integers representing the parents of nodes for two different trees. The key insight is to realize that for two trees to be considered structurally identical, they must share the same parent-child relationships across all nodes when both trees are rooted at the same node. Therefore, we need to count how many ways we can choose a root node such that the trees defined by the given relationships can match.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a hash map (or unordered_map) to count how many times each node appears as a parent in both trees.
2. **Check Validity**: For each node that appears as a parent in one of the trees, check if it appears in the other tree as well. If any node only appears in one tree, it indicates that the trees cannot be made identical.
3. **Calculate the Result**: For nodes that are common in both trees, we essentially say we can choose any of these nodes as a root, and as long as the structures of the trees match under such a root, we can reconstruct similarly. The result will be the product of these options.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes (since we can traverse both trees in linear time).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the counts of parent occurrences.

        }

        for (const auto& [node, count] : count1) {
            if (count2[node] == 0) return 0; // Node exists in tree1 but not in tree2
            result *= count2[node];
        }
