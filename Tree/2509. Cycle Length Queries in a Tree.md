# **[Cycle Length Queries in a Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/cycle-length-queries-in-a-tree/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem presents a scenario where we have a tree structure with nodes numbered from 1 to `n`. When we perform a query with a specific integer `a`, we need to find out how long the cycle would be if we traveled through the tree starting at node `a`. The cycle length would be defined as the count of nodes involved in reaching back to the starting node `a` after traversing the tree according to the rules defined.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: The root of the tree is at node 1, and all other nodes are assigned sequentially. The left child of a node `i` is `2*i`, and the right child is `2*i + 1`. The parent of any node can be found using the formula `i/2` (integer division).
  
2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: For each query, to compute the cycle length for a given `a`, travel upward from node `a` to the root, storing the path. This will give the sequence of nodes leading to the root. After reaching the root, the depth of node `a` can also be determined. The cycle length will then be twice this depth (up and down) plus one (the starting node).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(n)) for each query, as moving up the tree from a node to the root takes logarithmic time in relation to the number of nodes.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(log(n)) for storing the path from the node to the root during processing.

            // Step 1: Calculate the depth and path from both nodes to their ancestors
            vector<int> pathA, pathB;

            while (a > 0) {
                pathA.push_back(a);
                a /= 2;
            }
            while (b > 0) {
                pathB.push_back(b);
                b /= 2;
            }

            // Step 2: Find the lowest common ancestor
            int i = pathA.size() - 1, j = pathB.size() - 1;
            while (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && pathA[i] == pathB[j]) {
                cycle_length++;
                i--;
                j--;
            }

            // Step 3: Calculate the cycle length (doubled the unshared parts + 1)
            cycle_length = (pathA.size() - cycle_length) + (pathB.size() - cycle_length) + 1;
            result.push_back(cycle_length);
        }
        return result;
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `CycleLengthQueries.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `CycleLengthQueries` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
