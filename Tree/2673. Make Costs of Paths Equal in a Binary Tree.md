# **[Make Costs of Paths Equal in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-costs-of-paths-equal-in-a-binary-tree/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem focuses on a binary tree where each edge has a certain cost. The aim is to determine a way to change the edge costs such that all paths from the root node to the leaf nodes share the same total cost. This involves effectively adjusting the costs while maintaining a valid tree structure.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. **Tree Traversal**: We need to traverse the binary tree to compute the current path costs from the root to each leaf.
2. **Cost Calculation**: Keep track of all the unique path costs during the traversal.
3. **Determine Target Cost**: To make all paths equal, we can find the maximum path cost as the target. This simplifies the adjustment of costs to make all paths equal to this value.
4. **Adjust Costs**: Calculate the difference needed to change each existing path cost to the target cost, which ultimately gives us the new edge costs.

This requires a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore each node and its children while maintaining a record of the current path cost.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, since we visit each node once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursive stack used during DFS.
