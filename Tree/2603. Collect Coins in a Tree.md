# **[Collect Coins in a Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/collect-coins-in-a-tree/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are given a tree represented as an undirected graph where nodes represent places that can either have or not have coins. Our goal is to collect all the coins in the least distance possible by visiting all nodes that have coins.

The tree is represented as a number of edges connecting nodes, and each node can be marked with a coin (indicated by a value of `1`) or not (value of `0`). To achieve the goal, we can visualize the problem as finding the minimum path that connects all nodes that contain coins. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
Here‚Äôs the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:
1. **Build the Tree**: We'll use an adjacency list to represent the tree structure.
2. **Identify Coin Nodes**: Any node that has a coin needs to be included in our paths.
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We will perform DFS from the root to count the distance needed to visit all coin nodes and return back to the starting position. This counts the total traversal distance.
4. **Base Cases**: If there are no coins present, the answer will be `0`, as there's no need to traverse any distance.

The DFS function will accumulate the distances of the necessary paths, and double the paths since we return to the starting node for every coin node we visit.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes as we visit each node once to construct the tree and again during DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the storage of the adjacency list representation of the tree.
