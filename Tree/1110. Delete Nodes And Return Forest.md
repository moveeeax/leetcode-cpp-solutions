# **[Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a binary tree and requires us to delete certain nodes based on specified values. When a node is deleted, its children should not be lost; instead, they are to be added to the "forest" (the collection of trees). The challenge is to efficiently traverse the tree and remove nodes while managing the relationships with their children appropriately. The entire solution revolves around a recursive depth-first traversal of the tree.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Recursive Traversal**: We will use a helper function to traverse the tree depth-first. This function will return the new root of the subtree after any nodes have been deleted.
2. **Node Deletion Logic**: For each node:
   - If the node‚Äôs value is in the set of nodes to be deleted:
     - We return nullptr, effectively deleting the node.
     - We need to ensure that its left and right children are converted into separate trees in the forest if they exist.
   - If the node is not to be deleted:
     - Recursively check and potentially delete the left and right children.
     - Construct a new tree from the current node including its non-null children.
3. **Forest Creation**: Whenever a node is deleted, we will store its left and right children if they are not null in a result vector which represents the forest of trees.
4. **Return the Forest**: After the traversal, we will return a list of the roots of the remaining trees.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), this would be O(n).

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `delete_nodes_and_return_forest.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
