# **[House Robber III](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The "House Robber III" problem presents a binary tree structure representing houses that can be robbed. Each node represents a house, and each house has a certain amount of money in it. The main goal is to maximize the amount of money robbed while adhering to the condition that you cannot rob two directly connected houses (i.e., you cannot rob a house and its immediate children). As this is framed in a tree structure, the problem is about selecting nodes while avoiding conflicts due to adjacency.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The primary approach is to use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) combined with dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to calculate for each house (node in the tree) the maximum value that can be obtained by either robbing that house or not robbing it.

1. **Recursive Function**: We define a recursive function that returns two values:
   - The maximum amount if the current house is robbed.
   - The maximum amount if the current house is not robbed.
  
2. **Robbing Logic**:
   - If we rob the current node, we cannot rob its children but can rob its grandchildren.
   - If we do not rob the current node, we can choose to rob any of its children.

3. **Base Case**: If we reach a null node, the maximum amount is zero, as there are no houses to rob.

4. **Dynamic Programming Technique**: We can optimize further by using memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) where h is the height of the tree, which is used for recursion stack space. In a balanced tree, this will be O(log n), but in the worst case (like a linked list), it could be O(n).

        int rob_this = node->val + left.second + right.second; // Rob this node
        int not_rob_this = max(left.first, left.second) + max(right.first, right.second); // Don't rob this node

        return {rob_this, not_rob_this};
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a test binary tree:
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(1);

    cout << "Maximum money that can be robbed: " << solution.rob(root) << endl;

    // Cleanup code for tree nodes omitted for brevity
    return 0;
