# **[Find Number of Coins to Place in Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-number-of-coins-to-place-in-tree-nodes/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to distribute coins among nodes in a binary tree such that every node has exactly one coin. Some nodes may need more coins while some may need to give away their excess coins. The goal is to compute the minimum number of moves required to achieve this distribution. A move is defined as moving a coin from one node to an adjacent node.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Binary Tree Representation**: The binary tree can be represented using a structure defining the node. Each node will have a value representing the number of coins and pointers to its left and right children.
  
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We will traverse the tree using DFS. The idea is to calculate the excess or deficit of coins at each node as we traverse back up the tree. 
   - **Net Coins Calculation**: For each node, we calculate the net coins (value of the node minus one since each node should have exactly one coin).
   - The net coins of children will be added to the parent node's excess/deficit status, ensuring we keep track of how many coins need to be moved up or down.
  
3. **Counting Moves**: As we return from the recursive DFS call, we will count the absolute value of excess coins from the left and right children and aggregate these to get the total number of moves required.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree since we visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack (in the worst case, this can be O(n) for a skewed tree, but on average, it will be O(log n) for balanced trees).
