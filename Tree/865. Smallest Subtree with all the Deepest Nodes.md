# **[Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem is about finding the smallest subtree that contains all the deepest nodes of a binary tree. The deepest nodes are the nodes that lie at the maximum depth of the tree. The smallest subtree encompassing these nodes will be the smallest parent node that can reach all of these deepest nodes.

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the depth of each node in the tree.
2. Identify all the nodes that are at the maximum depth.
3. Determine the smallest subtree that contains all these deepest nodes, which will be a node that has all deepest nodes in its subtree.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. **Depth Calculation**: Use a recursive function to traverse the tree, keeping track of the depth of each node.
2. **Identify Deepest Nodes**: While traversing, also keep track of the deepest nodes found so far and their common ancestor. If a node can reach multiple deepest nodes, it could potentially be the answer.
3. **Return the Result**: The result will be the node that serves as the smallest subtree that contains all the deepest nodes.

This strategy ensures that each node is processed only once, allowing us to find the answer efficiently.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since we traverse each node once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack in the worst case scenario of an unbalanced tree.
