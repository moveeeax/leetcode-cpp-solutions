# **[Binary Tree Cameras](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves placing cameras in a binary tree to monitor all nodes. A camera can monitor its parent, itself, and its direct children. The main goal is to ensure all nodes in the binary tree are covered by cameras while minimizing the number of cameras used.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **DFS Traversal**: We will perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree. For each node, we determine the state:
   - Node is covered by a camera.
   - Node has a camera installed.
   - Node is not covered and doesn't have a camera.
   
2. **State Representation**:
   - Using an integer return value to define the state:
     - Return `0` if the node is covered (either by itself or by its children).
     - Return `1` if the node has a camera.
     - Return `2` if the node is not covered and does not have a camera.

3. **Camera Installation Logic**: 
   - If the left or right child is not covered (i.e., returns `2`), we must install a camera at the current node (incrementing the camera count).
   - If any child returns `1`, it implies that it has a camera, and the current node is covered. 
   - In the end, if the root node is not covered after the DFS, we need to place a camera at the root.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree due to the recursion stack.

    int dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return 0;

        int left = dfs(node->left);

        if (left == 2 || right == 2) {
            cameraCount++;
            return 1; // Current node has a camera
        }
        
        return (left == 1 || right == 1) ? 0 : 2; // 0 - covered, 2 - not covered
    }

    int minCameraCover(TreeNode* root) {
        if (dfs(root) == 2) {
            cameraCount++; // If root is not covered, add a camera
        }
        return cameraCount;
    }
};

        }
        
        return (left == 1 || right == 1) ? 0 : 2; // 0 - covered, 2 - not covered
    }

    int minCameraCover(TreeNode* root) {
        if (dfs(root) == 2) {
            cameraCount++; // If root is not covered, add a camera
        }
        return cameraCount;
    }
};

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(0);
    root->left = new TreeNode(0);
    root->right = new TreeNode(0);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(0);
