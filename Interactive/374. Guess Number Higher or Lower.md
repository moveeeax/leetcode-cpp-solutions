# **[Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem entails a guessing game where you must determine a hidden number from a preset range. The game provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The objective is to efficiently pinpoint the correct number using the fewest guesses. A binary search strategy is appropriate here, as it effectively reduces the search space by half with each guess based on feedback received.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Defining the Problem**: The game specifies the number range, `1` to `n`, and the player must guess the hidden number through a series of well-informed guesses. The allowed time complexity is logarithmic, suggesting the implementation of binary search, a standard approach for sorted structures or ranges.

2. **Binary Search Method**: 
   - Initialize the lower and upper bounds of the search range (`low = 1` and `high = n`).
   - Calculate the mid-point of the current search range.
   - Use the `guess` API to obtain feedback about the guess:
     - If the guess is too low, shift the lower bound up (`low = mid + 1`).
     - If the guess is too high, shift the upper bound down (`high = mid - 1`).
     - If the guess is correct, return the guessed number.

3. **Repeat** the process until the correct number is found. This method guarantees finding the number in `O(log n)` time.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) - Each guess effectively halves the search space.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - The solution uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1, high = n;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int result = guess(mid);
            if (result == 0) {
                return mid;
            } else if (result == -1) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Should not reach here
    }
};
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `GuessNumberHigherOrLower.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()` and include the implementation of the `guess` function for testing.  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Mock guess function for local testing.
int secretNumber = 6; // Example secret number

int guess(int num) {
    if (num < secretNumber) return 1; // my guess is lower
    if (num > secretNumber) return -1; // my guess is higher
    return 0; // correct guess
}

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1, high = n;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int result = guess(mid);
            if (result == 0) {
                return mid;
            } else if (result == -1) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Should not reach here
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 10; // Range from 1 to n
    int result = solution.guessNumber(n);
    cout << "The guessed number is: " << result << endl; // Expected output is 6
    return 0;
}
