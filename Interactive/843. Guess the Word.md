# **[Guess the Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The task is to guess a hidden word from a set of candidate words, utilizing a scoring system provided by a `Master` object that returns feedback on our guesses. Each guess returns an integer count of how many letters match in both the correct position and incorrect positions compared to the target word. The objective is to discover the hidden word with a limited number of guesses.

### **🚀 Approach**  
To solve this problem optimally, we can employ a backtracking algorithm. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We will receive a list of words as potential candidates and a `Master` API for feedback on our guesses.
  
2. **Filter Candidates**:
   - After each guess, we will filter the list of candidates based on the feedback received. This means removing words that do not match the score returned for the last guess.

3. **Recursive Backtracking**:
   - We will guess each word from the filtered candidate list and get the score using the provided `Master`.
   - Based on the score, we will filter the candidates again.

4. **Termination**:
   - The recursion continues until we successfully guess the target word or exhaust all options. 

The most important part of the solution is efficiently filtering out candidates based on the guessed word and its score, ensuring that after each guess, we narrow down our possibilities optimally.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of candidates and m is the length of the words because for each guess we are filtering all candidates based on scoring.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of candidates as we keep a list of candidates at each recursion level.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void findSecretWord(vector<string>& wordlist, Master& master) {
        vector<string> candidates = wordlist;
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
            string guess = candidates[0];
            int score = master.guess(guess);

## **3️⃣ Running Locally**  
### **✅ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `guess_the_word.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
