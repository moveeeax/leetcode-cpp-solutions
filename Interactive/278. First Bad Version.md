# **[First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is essentially about finding the first bad version of a product when provided a method `bool isBadVersion(int version)` which tells us whether a given version is bad. The key insight is that once we know a version is bad, all subsequent versions will also be bad. This indicates that we can use a binary search approach to efficiently narrow down the possible versions.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The algorithm relies on performing a binary search:

1. **Initialization**: Set two pointers, `left` to 1 and `right` to `n` (the total number of versions). 
2. **Binary Search Loop**: 
   - While `left` is less than `right`, calculate the middle version using `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`.
   - Use the `isBadVersion(mid)` function to check if the middle version is bad.
     - If it is bad, this means that the first bad version is either this version or could be an earlier version. Thus, adjust the `right` pointer to `mid`.
     - If it is not bad, then the first bad version must be in the versions after `mid`, so adjust the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
3. **Termination**: When `left` meets `right`, it indicates we've found the first bad version, which is at position `left`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) - The binary search reduces the problem size in half each iteration, making it logarithmic.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We are using a constant amount of space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid;  // Mid is bad, so the first bad version is at mid or earlier
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;  // Mid is good, search in the right half
            }
        }
        return left;  // left is the first bad version
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `first_bad_version.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Mock function to simulate isBadVersion API
bool isBadVersion(int version) {
    const int firstBadVersion = 4; // Assuming version 4 is the first bad version
    return version >= firstBadVersion;
}

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid;  // Mid is bad, so the first bad version is at mid or earlier
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;  // Mid is good, search in the right half
            }
        }
        return left;  // left is the first bad version
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 5; // Number of versions
    int result = solution.firstBadVersion(n);
    cout << "The first bad version is: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
