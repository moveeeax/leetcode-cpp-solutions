# **[Find Champion I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-champion-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to identify a "champion" from a list of players based on their scores in the given matches. A player can be considered a champion if they win against all other players, either directly by having a higher score, or through transitive wins where one player wins against another, forming a path of victories. Therefore, our approach will need to account for both direct and indirect victories.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Representation**: We can represent each player and their scores in a structure like an array or vector, where each index corresponds to a player's ID and their score.
2. **Graph Representation**: To handle the relationships between players (who wins against whom), a directed graph can be used where an edge from A to B indicates that player A wins against player B. 
3. **Winner Identification**: 
   - Track wins for each player using a win count. 
   - If a player has won against all other players (win count is equal to the total players minus 1), then that player is a champion. 
   - Keep track of players who have the maximum scores and check if they meet the champion criteria.
4. **Iterative Comparison**: Iterate through the players to compare scores and establish direct wins, filling up our win count accordingly.
5. **Final Decision**: If more than one player has the maximum score but not winning against each other, then we return -1 indicating there's no distinct champion. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case where each player must be compared against every other player.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing player scores and win counts.

                } else {
                    return -1; // more than one champion found
                }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `find_champion_i.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
