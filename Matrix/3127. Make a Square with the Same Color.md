# **[Make a Square with the Same Color](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-a-square-with-the-same-color/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining whether we can form a square using a given number of colored tiles on a grid, where each tile is either black or white. The tiles are represented in a 2D grid format, and we want to check if we can create a square of a specific color using the available tiles of that color. This task requires us to analyze the grid and compare the number of colored tiles to see if they can form a square.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Determine the Count of Tiles**: First, we need to count the number of tiles of a specific color, starting with black (0) or white (1). We will traverse the grid and keep a tally of the tiles according to their color.
  
2. **Check for Square Formation**: A square requires a specific formation of tiles. For an integer `k`, a square of size `k` requires `k^2` tiles of the same color. Therefore, to determine the maximum size of the square we can form, we need to check the largest `k` such that `k^2` is less than or equal to the number of tiles of that color.

3. **Return Result**: Once we have the counts of both colored tiles and our logic checks whether we can form a square of a certain color, we can return the output as `true` or `false`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows or columns in the grid as we need to traverse each tile in the nested grid.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of additional space for counters.
