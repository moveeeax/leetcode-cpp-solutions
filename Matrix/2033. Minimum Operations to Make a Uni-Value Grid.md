# **[Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-uni-value-grid/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to transform a given 2D grid of integers into a uni-value grid, where all elements have the same value. To achieve this with the minimum number of operations, we can change any number of cells in the grid to the value of any other cell in the grid. 

To solve this problem, the best strategy is to convert all cells to one of the existing unique values in the grid because changing to a value not already present will require additional operations. By focusing on the most frequent value, we can minimize the operations required. Thus, our task essentially reduces to finding the most common value in the grid and calculating how many cells are not that value.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Traverse the grid to count the occurrences of each unique value using a hash map (or unordered_map in C++). 
2. Track the maximum frequency of any single value while traversing. 
3. The minimum number of operations required will be the total number of elements in the grid minus the highest frequency found during the counting step. This is because the remaining elements will need to be modified to match this most common value.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m √ó n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. We need to examine each cell once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique values in the grid, which can be at most m * n but is generally significantly smaller.
