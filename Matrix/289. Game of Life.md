# **[Game of Life](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells that can be either alive (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the problem statement):  

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Our task is to update the state of the board in place, based on these rules. Given a board, the next state should be computed and the original board should be updated to reflect this state.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a hybrid approach with bit masking to represent the state of cells after the transition. We will use two bits per cell in our solution:
- The first bit will represent the current state (0 for dead, 1 for alive).
- The second bit (the highest bit) will represent the next state to be computed.

**Here's how we can implement the solution:**

1. Traverse the board and count the number of live neighbors for each cell.
2. Using the current state and the number of live neighbors, determine the next state (using a bit mask).
3. Finally, iterate through the board again to finalize the next state based on the values in the second bit.

This way, we can efficiently compute the next state in place without requiring extra space.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the board. We traverse the board multiple times but each time takes linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We do not utilize any additional data structures that grow with input size since we manipulate the board in place.
