# **[Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum wealth among a set of customers, where each customer's wealth is represented by the number of individual bank accounts they possess and the corresponding amounts in those accounts. The wealth of a customer is the sum of all amounts from their bank accounts. Given a 2D array where each inner array corresponds to a customer and contains their respective bank account balances, we need to find and return the maximum wealth that any customer has.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we need to iterate through the 2D array, calculating the total wealth for each customer by summing the values in each inner array. We can keep track of the maximum wealth found during this iteration. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Initialize a variable to store the maximum wealth (set it to a minimum value initially).
2. Loop through each customer in the 2D array:
   - For each customer, calculate the sum of their bank account balances.
   - If the calculated sum (wealth) is greater than the current maximum wealth, update the maximum wealth.
3. After processing all customers, return the maximum wealth.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of customers and n is the average number of bank accounts per customer. We visit each account once to sum the wealth.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a fixed amount of additional space for the maximum wealth variable.

                currentWealth += account;
            }
            if (currentWealth > maxWealth) {
                maxWealth = currentWealth;
            }
        }
        return maxWealth;
    }

public:
    int maximumWealth(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) {
        int maxWealth = 0;
        for (const auto& customer : accounts) {
            int currentWealth = 0;
            for (const auto& account : customer) {
                currentWealth += account;
            }
            if (currentWealth > maxWealth) {
                maxWealth = currentWealth;
            }
        }
        return maxWealth;
    }
};

int main() {
    RichestCustomerWealth solution;
    vector<vector<int>> accounts = {{1, 2, 3}, {3, 2, 1}, {4, 5, 6}};
    cout << "Maximum Wealth: " << solution.maximumWealth(accounts) << endl; // Output: 15
    return 0;
}
