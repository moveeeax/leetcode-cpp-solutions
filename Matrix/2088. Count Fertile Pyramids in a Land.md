# **[Count Fertile Pyramids in a Land](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-fertile-pyramids-in-a-land/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves counting the number of "fertile pyramids" that can be constructed in a given grid of land represented by a 2D matrix composed of zeros and ones. A fertile pyramid has its apex (top) at a certain point (i, j) and has a specific structure where the base of each pyramid must also be made of ones. 

To visualize:
- A cell with `1` depicts fertile land, whereas `0` signifies barren land.
- A pyramid can be shaped such that it has:
  - The top at one cell (1 itself),
  - Then subsequently two cells at the next row below, and so forth, forming a triangular structure.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the height of the pyramid that can be constructed with the apex at `(i, j)`. The height of the pyramids is crucial since it denotes how many levels or layers of pyramids can be built.
2. **Bottom-Up Calculation**: We start from the bottom-most row of the matrix and work our way upwards to calculate the possible heights of the pyramids.
   - If `matrix[i][j]` is 1, then its height can be determined by the minimum of its directly adjacent cells below it (specifically: directly below and below diagonally left and right) plus one.
3. **Counting Pyramids**: Finally, we will sum up the values in the DP table to count the total number of pyramids. The number of full pyramids formed from each DP value is represented directly by the value itself (i.e., a height of `h` implies `h` pyramids).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid due to the single pass required to fill the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the DP array. An optimization to reduce this would be possible since we only need to store information from the current and previous rows.
