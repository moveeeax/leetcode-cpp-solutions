# **[Surface Area of 3D Shapes](https://leetcode.com/problems/surface-area-of-3d-shapes/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to calculate the surface area of a 3D shape constructed from cubes based on a 2D grid representation. Each non-zero entry in the grid indicates a stack of cubes, where the value represents the height of cubes at that position. The challenge is to correctly account for shared (hidden) surfaces between adjacent cubes and compute the surface area accurately.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initial Surface Calculation**: Each cube contributes a base surface area of \(6\) squares to the total surface area. However, when cubes are adjacent (either horizontally or vertically), they share surfaces which reduce the visible area.
  
2. **Iterate through the grid**: We will loop through each cell in the grid:
   - For each cell, if its corresponding height is `h`, it contributes \(6 \times h\) to the surface area.
  
3. **Adjust for shared surfaces**:
   - If a cube is adjacent to another cube (top, bottom, left, or right), the shared surface between them should be subtracted from the total visible area.
   - For instance, if the cube on the left has height `h1` and the current cube has height `h2`, they share a vertical surface area of \(2 \times \min(h1, h2)\).
  
4. **Final Calculation**: Keep track of and subtract the shared surfaces as we process the entire grid.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid, since we need to visit each cell once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of space for calculations and do not utilize any additional data structures that scale with input size.
