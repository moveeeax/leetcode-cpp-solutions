# **[Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-two-groups-of-points/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves connecting two groups of points on a 2D plane with minimal cost. Each point in the first group can connect to every point in the second group, and the connection cost between two points is defined as the Manhattan distance between them. Our goal is to find the minimum cost to connect all points in the first group with all points in the second group.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We can approach this problem using a bitmask dynamic programming strategy, as we want to explore each combination of points from both groups. The key idea is:
1. We represent the selection of points from the second group using a bitmask.
2. We iteratively calculate the total cost for connecting all selected points in the second group to the points in the first group.
3. Using dynamic programming, we compute the minimum cost required to connect the first group to every possible selection of points from the second group by maintaining a cost array.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^m * n) where m is the number of points in the second group and n is the number of points in the first group.
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^m) for storing costs for each subset of the second group.

public:
    int connectTwoGroups(vector<vector<int>>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size();
        int m = cost[0].size();
        int totalStates = 1 << m; // Total combinations of points in the second group
        vector<int> dp(totalStates, INT_MAX); // Cost to connect first group to each subset of second group
        dp[0] = 0; // Cost to connect to an empty subset is 0

        // Iterate over each point in the first group
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = totalStates - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                // For each chosen subset of second group
                if (dp[j] == INT_MAX) continue; // Skip if this subset is not reachable
                // Try to add each point from second group
                for (int k = 0; k < m; ++k) {
                    int newState = j | (1 << k); // Adding point k to the subset
                    dp[newState] = min(dp[newState], dp[j] + cost[i][k]);
                }
            }

        // The answer is the cost to connect to all points in the second group: all bits set
        return dp[totalStates - 1];
