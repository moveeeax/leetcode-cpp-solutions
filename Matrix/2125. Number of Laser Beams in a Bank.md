# **[Number of Laser Beams in a Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-laser-beams-in-a-bank/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to calculate the total number of laser beams created in a bank scenario described by a 2D grid, where '1' represents a security device (which emits laser beams) and '0' represents empty space. A laser beam can be created between two security devices that are on different rows. Specifically, if there are `m` devices in row `i` and `n` devices in row `j` (where `i < j`), they can create `m * n` laser beams. Our goal is to sum all such beams across the grid.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Iterate through each row of the matrix.
2. Count the number of security devices (represented by '1') in the current row.
3. Keep track of the last row where we found devices. 
4. Each time we find devices in a new row, calculate the beams formed with the devices from the last row. 
5. Update the total count of beams accordingly.
6. Continue until all rows are processed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the average number of columns since we go through every cell in the grid.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of additional space regardless of input size.

            int count = count(row.begin(), row.end(), '1');  // Count '1's in the current row
            if (count > 0) {
                // If there are devices in the current row, calculate beams with the last row
                totalBeams += last * count;
                last = count;  // Update last to the current count
            }
