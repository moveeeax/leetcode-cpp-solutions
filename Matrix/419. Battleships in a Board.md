# **[Battleships in a Board](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem requires us to calculate the number of battleships present on a given 2D board. A battleship is represented as a continuous horizontal or vertical line of `'X'` characters, and it's important to only count each battleship once. The ships may be positioned anywhere on the board, and the water is represented by `'.'`. The key observation is that we can count a battleship each time we encounter an `'X'` character that is either the first in its row or the first in its column. This way, we can ensure that we only count each battleship exactly once, regardless of its size.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start with a count variable to zero.
2. **Iterate through the board**: Use a nested loop where the outer loop iterates through the rows and the inner loop iterates through the columns of the board.
3. **Identify the start of a battleship**:
   - If the current cell is `'X'` and either it is the first cell in that row or the first cell in that column, then we have identified the start of a battleship.
   - Increment the count each time a starting point of a battleship is found.
4. **Return the count**: After scanning through the entire board, return the total count of battleships.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the board.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
