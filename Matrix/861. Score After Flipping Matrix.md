# **[Score After Flipping Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
We are given a binary matrix, and we want to maximize the score after potentially flipping some rows. The score is calculated based on the first column of the binary matrix and subsequent columns that represent the binary values of the remaining bits. Each row can be flipped, which means the binary bits can be inverted from `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`. The goal is to find the maximum score after performing row flips.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Flipping Strategy**:  
   - The first column is critical since its value affects the overall score the most. To maximize a score, we want as many `1`s as possible in the first column. If there are more `0`s in the first column than `1`s, we flip all rows, ensuring the first column has all `1`s.
  
2. **Calculating Score**:  
   - After adjusting the first column to maximize the score, we compute the binary value represented by each row. 
   - For each row, convert the remaining bits into a decimal and sum them all to get the final score.

3. **Efficiency**:  
   - Instead of flipping rows and recalculating every time, we can use a counter for the number of `1`s. This will help determine if flipping is beneficial for the first column. We can evaluate the remaining bits efficiently.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. We need to iterate through each cell once to compute the score.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a few variables to store counts and do not require additional data structures based on input size.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int matrixScore(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        int m = A.size(), n = A[0].size();
        int score = (1 << (n - 1)) * m; // Initial score with all 1's in the first column.

        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            int countOnes = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                // Check if the first element of the row is 0 or 1 when deciding to count the elements
                if (A[i][0] == 1) {
                    countOnes += A[i][j];
                } else {
                    countOnes += 1 - A[i][j]; // Count 1 if we flip the row
                }
            }
            // Choose the maximum of the count of 1's directly or flipping them
            score += max(countOnes, m - countOnes) * (1 << (n - j - 1));
        }

        return score;
    }
};
