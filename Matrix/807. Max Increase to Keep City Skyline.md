# **[Max Increase to Keep City Skyline](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-increase-to-keep-city-skyline/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around maintaining the skyline of a city, represented as a 2D grid where each element specifies the height of a building at that position. The aim is to determine how much we can increase the heights of these buildings without altering the city skyline when viewed from the north, east, south, and west directions. The skyline is determined by the maximum height in each row and each column.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Maximum Heights**: First, we need to determine the maximum height for each row and each column in the grid. This can easily be done by iterating over the grid and storing the maximum heights in two separate arrays (one for rows and one for columns).
  
2. **Calculate Increase**: Once we have the maximum heights, we can iterate through the grid again. For each building, the new height it can be increased to is limited by the minimum of the maximum row height and the maximum column height for that building's position. Thus, the increase for each building can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{increase} = \min(\text{maxRow}[i], \text{maxCol}[j]) - \text{grid}[i][j]
   \]
   where `grid[i][j]` is the current height of the building.

3. **Summation**: We sum all possible increases to get the desired total increase.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid. We traverse the grid multiple times but each traversal is linear in terms of the number of buildings.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for storing the row and column maximums.
