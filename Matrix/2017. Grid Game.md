# **[Grid Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves two players competing on a grid with constraints on movements. Player 1 moves from the first row to the last, while Player 2 can move on the second row. Each cell in the grid contains points, and the goal is to maximize the points collected by the player who has to wait for the opponent to finish before collecting their points. Thus, the task is to find the maximum points Player 1 can collect while considering Player 2's optimal strategy.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we will:
1. Calculate the total points Player 2 can potentially collect from their starting row down to the last row in a way that maximizes their score.
2. Simulate the collection of points for Player 1 as they move down the first row.
3. Determine the optimal score for Player 1 by subtracting Player 2's maximum points collected up to any given column from the total points Player 1 could collect from their start.

We will:
- Calculate prefix sums for both rows to facilitate quick score calculations.
- Iterate through possible column selections and use the prefix sums to determine the maximum possible points Player 1 can collect while factoring in Player 2's score.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of columns, as we iterate through the columns once to calculate maximum points.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are only using a few extra variables to keep track of scores.

            currentSum2 += grid[1][j]; // Update Player 2's score
            
            // Player 1's potential scores while Player 2 collects from the left
            long long player1Collect = sum1 - grid[0][j];
            
            // Maximum points Player 2 can collect until this column
            maxPoints = min(maxPoints, max(currentSum2, player1Collect));
        }
        
        return maxPoints;
    }
