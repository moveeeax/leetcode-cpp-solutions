# **[Stamping the Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/stamping-the-grid/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The challenge is to determine if we can transform a binary grid into another grid by applying a fixed size "stamp" (which is represented by `target` grid filled with `1`s) to it. The stamp can be placed at any valid location on the grid, and once placed, it stamps (i.e., effectively converts the cell values to `1`) the area of the stamp. Our goal is to find whether we can completely transform the `grid` into `target` through stamping operations, which may overlap.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initial Validity Check**: First, check if the dimensions of `grid` and `target` are the same, as stamping operations must cover the same area.
2. **Create a Difference Grid**: A grid that captures the differences in values between `grid` and `target`. This grid should be composed of `1`s where `grid` has a `0` and `0`s where they match.
3. **Simulating Stamping**: For every position that can be stamped (any position from (0,0) to (m-n, n-m) inclusive), simulate the stamp operation on the difference grid. If after stamping we can convert the difference grid into all zeros, it means we can achieve our objective.
4. **Result Evaluation**: Finally, check if all values in the difference grid are `0`, which indicates a complete transformation.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. Every cell is checked at most a fixed number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), for storing the difference grid.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. Create a file: `stamping_the_grid.cpp`  
2. Wrap the `Solution` class inside `main()`  
3. Include necessary headers  
4. Handle input/output for local execution  
5. Compile and run the program
