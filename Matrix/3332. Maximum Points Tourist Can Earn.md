# **[Maximum Points Tourist Can Earn](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-tourist-can-earn/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem presents a scenario where a tourist can visit several cities and accumulate points by attending events, but these events come with a restriction on consecutive visits. We can think of this as a variation of the well-known dynamic programming problem where we try to maximize a value (in this case, points) while adhering to certain constraints. The key constraint here is not visiting two consecutive cities, akin to the common problem of choosing non-adjacent items to maximize a sum.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
Given an array of points where each index corresponds to points obtained from visiting that city, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We'll maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i]` holds the maximum points that can be earned by visiting up to the `i`-th city. The recurrence relation is based on the decision of visiting or skipping the current city:

- If we visit city `i`, we cannot visit city `i-1`, thus the points we get will be the points in city `i` plus the best points up to `i-2`.
- If we skip city `i`, we can take the best points up to `i-1`.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
- `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], points[i] + (i > 1 ? dp[i-2] : 0))`

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) since we traverse the array of points once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we only need to store the last two computed results (instead of maintaining the entire dp array).

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int points = questions[i][0];
            int nextIndex = i + questions[i][1] + 1; // index to jump
            
            int current = max(prev1, points + (nextIndex < n ? prev2 : 0));
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }
