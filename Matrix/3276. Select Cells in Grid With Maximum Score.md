# **[Select Cells in Grid With Maximum Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/select-cells-in-grid-with-maximum-score/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a grid where each cell has a score. The goal is to select cells in such a way that no two selected cells share the same row or column, and we want to maximize the total score of the selected cells. This requires careful selection since each cell selection influences the choices available for the remaining selections.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding Input/Output**: The input consists of a grid of integers representing the scores, and we need to output the maximum total score possible by selecting the cells under the given constraints.
2. **Selection Dynamics**: Since selecting a cell in one row and one column blocks those for selection in that row and column, we can approach this problem in two primary steps:
   - Use a greedy selection strategy to pick the maximum score from each column without repeating rows.
   - Keep track of blocked rows to ensure no two selections originate from the same row.
3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Iterate through each column and maintain the highest available score from that column, checking against previously selected cells to avoid row conflicts.
   - Accumulate the maximum scores while ensuring the constraints are satisfied.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns since we may need to evaluate each cell.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for the storage of blocked rows and used columns.
