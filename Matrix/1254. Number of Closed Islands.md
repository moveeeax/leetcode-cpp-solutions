# **[Number of Closed Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about finding the number of "closed islands" in a 2D grid consisting of `0`s (representing water) and `1`s (representing land). A closed island is a group of `0`s that is completely surrounded by `1`s. This means that the group of `0`s cannot touch the grid's border. It requires us to explore the grid and effectively perform a flood-fill or depth-first search (DFS) to count such islands.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Traverse Each Cell**: Iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell has a `0` (indicating water that could belong to a closed island), proceed to explore further.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Start a DFS from this cell. During the DFS:
   - Mark the cell as visited (to prevent counting the same island multiple times).
   - The algorithm checks all four directions (up, down, left, right) recursively.
   - Importantly, if during the DFS any part of the island touches the border of the grid, we must mark it as not a closed island.
3. **Counting Closed Islands**: For every unvisited `0` cell that initiates a DFS without touching the border, we increment our closed island counter.
4. **Return Count**: After checking all cells, return the total number of closed islands found.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid, since we might potentially visit each cell.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) in the worst case for the recursive stack if we use DFS, or O(1) if using an iterative approach with a queue.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `NumberOfClosedIslands.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `NumberOfClosedIslands` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
