# **[Image Overlap](https://leetcode.com/problems/image-overlap/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves two square binary matrices `A` and `B` of size `N x N` that represent images. Each element in these matrices can either be 0 (black pixel) or 1 (white pixel). The goal is to determine the maximum overlap of the two images when we slide one of the images over the other.

To find the overlap, we can slide one image over the other in various ways and compute the number of overlapping white pixels (1s). The sum of overlapping pixels will vary depending on the position of the slides, and our task is to find the maximum sum.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Brute Force Overlap Calculation**: 
   - We will consider all possible translations (slides) of matrix `A` over matrix `B`, which means iterating over every possible position where `A` can slide relative to `B`.
   - The relative translation can be characterized by two integers (x, y) where `x` indicates horizontal displacement and `y` indicates vertical displacement.
   
2. **Sliding Logic**:
   - For each possible translation:
     - Calculate the number of overlapping 1s by looping through the valid indices where the translation is feasible.
     - Count the overlapping 1s only when both `A` and `B` have 1s at the same position.

3. **Max Overlap Tracking**:
   - Keep track of the maximum count of overlapping pixels as we evaluate each translation.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^4)  
   We have O(N^2) pairs (i, j) for the first matrix `A`, and for each of these, we check overlaps against `N*N` valid positions for the second matrix `B`, leading to a total of O(N^3). But since we also need to slide `A` against `B` at every position, we count O(N^2) for each slide, resulting in O(N^4) in the worst-case scenario.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)  
   We are using constant space for the overlaps since we do not require any extra data structures proportional to the input size.

                            overlap += A[i][j] & B[i + x][j + y];
