# **[Block Placement Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/block-placement-queries/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves simulating a sequence of block placements on a 2D grid of size `n x n`. Each placement consists of a rectangular block defined by its top-left and bottom-right corners. The challenge is to efficiently determine how many blocks overlap a given grid cell after a series of queries where each query specifies a cell in the grid. 

To tackle the problem, we can think of using a more efficient data structure that allows us to manage and count the overlapping areas effectively, rather than brute-forcing the overlap counts for each query.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Representation**: Use a 2D difference array to represent the grid. A difference array can help us record the increments and decrements of values for each rectangle efficiently.
2. **Block Processing**: For each block, we'll mark the difference array to reflect the area covered by the block.
    - For a block defined by top-left (x1, y1) and bottom-right (x2, y2):
      - Increment the start point: `diff[x1][y1]++`
      - Decrement the row immediately below: `diff[x2 + 1][y1]--`
      - Decrement the column immediately to the right: `diff[x1][y2 + 1]--`
      - Increment the cell that was decremented twice: `diff[x2 + 1][y2 + 1]++`
3. **Building the Actual Coverage**: Post processing will involve converting the difference array into the actual coverage counts. We can do this by calculating the prefix sums in both dimensions.
4. **Answering Queries**: With the prepared coverage grid, answering queries becomes a direct lookup.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(k + n^2) where k is the number of blocks and n^2 is the cost to compute the final counts from the difference array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the grid and the difference array.
