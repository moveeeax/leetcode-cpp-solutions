# **[Peaks in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/peaks-in-array/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires identifying "peaks" in an array, where a peak is defined as an element that is greater than its immediate neighbors. The goal is to find the number of such peaks for a given array. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we will iterate through the array and check each element (excluding the first and last) to determine if it is a peak. For an element `arr[i]` to be considered a peak, it must satisfy the condition:
- `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`

This approach involves:
1. Initializing a counter to keep track of the peaks.
2. Iterating through the array from the second element to the second-to-last element.
3. Checking the peak condition for each element.
4. Incrementing the counter when a peak is found.
5. Returning the count at the end.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array since we only make a single pass through the array to count peaks.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a fixed amount of space regardless of input size.

```cpp
class PeaksInArray {
public:
    int countPeaks(vector<int>& arr) {
        int peaks = 0;
        int n = arr.size();
        
        // Iterate through the array checking for peaks
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1] && arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                peaks++;
            }
        }
        
        return peaks;
    }
};

int main() {
    PeaksInArray solver;
    vector<int> testArray = {1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 6}; // Example input
    int result = solver.countPeaks(testArray);
    cout << "Number of peaks: " << result << endl; // Expected output: 3
    return 0;
}
