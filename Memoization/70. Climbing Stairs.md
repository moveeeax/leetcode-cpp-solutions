# **[Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase of `n` steps while being allowed to take either 1 or 2 steps at a time. This can be viewed as a combinatorial problem where we need to find how many unique sequences of 1s and 2s can sum up to `n`. The thought process leads to the realization that each step's result can be derived from the previous two results, similar to the Fibonacci series.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Base Cases**: 
   - If there are 0 steps (`n = 0`), there is 1 way to be at the ground (by doing nothing).
   - If there is 1 step (`n = 1`), there is only 1 way to climb it (by taking a single step).

2. **Recursive Formula**: 
   - For `n >= 2`, the total distinct ways to reach step `n` can be expressed as: 
     `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)`
   This is because you could either arrive from the `n-1` step (taking 1 step) or from the `n-2` step (taking 2 steps).

3. **Dynamic Programming**: 
   - We can leverage a dynamic programming approach where we store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations. This allows us to compute the result in linear time.

4. **Optimized Space**: 
   - Instead of maintaining an entire array for the steps, we can only keep track of the last two computed values since each state only depends on the last two states.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) ‚Äì We compute the result iteratively in a single loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) ‚Äì We only use two variables to store the last two counts instead of an array.
