# **[Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of one-bit operations needed to effectively set a given integer \( n \) to zero. A one-bit operation is defined as flipping the value of a single bit in the binary representation of the integer. We need to find an efficient way to compute the required flips based on the binary representation patterns of integers.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. The crux of the problem relies on understanding the relationship between the bits of the integer \( n \). The operation can be visualized as needing to perform operations in a systematic way to minimize the total number of bits that need flipping.
2. We can leverage the recursive property of numbers and binary representations to efficiently compute the result. If we analyze the binary representation of \( n \), we notice that changing bits will depend on their positions and the changes made to neighboring bits.
3. Instead of recursively computing the number of flips, we can observe a specific pattern—specifically that for an integer \( n \), the number of operations can be computed using a simple bit manipulation trick based on the structure of \( n \).

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), since we are examining the bits of the integer which can be at most \( \log_2(n) \).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
