# **[Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the length of the longest subsequence of a binary string that, when considered as a number in binary, does not exceed a given integer `k`. A subsequence can be formed by deleting some characters from the string without changing the order of the remaining characters. 

### **🚀 Approach**  
The strategy involves using a two-pointer technique to traverse the binary string while simultaneously constructing the binary number corresponding to the subsequence. Here are the steps:

1. **Define Two Pointers**: One pointer will iterate over the binary string and the other pointer will track the constructed binary number.
2. **Construct the Binary Number**: As we iterate through the string from the left, the binary number will be updated. For each character '1', we include it in the number if it does not cause it to exceed `k`.
3. **Count Valid Subsequence Length**: For every valid addition to the binary number (i.e., it does not exceed `k`), we increase the length of the subsequence.
4. **Early Exit**: If the binary number exceeds `k`, we stop processing further digits. 

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the binary string, since we process each character at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a fixed amount of extra space for variables regardless of the input size.

## **2️⃣ LeetCode Submission**  
```cpp
class LongestBinarySubsequence {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(string s, int k) {
        int length = 0; // To count the valid subsequence length
        int currentNumber = 0; // To represent the current binary number
        int size = s.size();

        // Traverse from the end to the beginning
        for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                // If current number plus the new '1' can fit in k
                if ((currentNumber | (1 << length)) <= k) {
                    currentNumber |= (1 << length);
                    ++length; // Increase length of valid subsequence
                }
            } else { // When it's '0'
                length++; // Always can take '0'
            }
        }

        return length; // Return the length of the longest subsequence
    }
};  
```
