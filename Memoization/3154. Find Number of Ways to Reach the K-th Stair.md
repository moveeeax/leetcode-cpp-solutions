# **[Find Number of Ways to Reach the K-th Stair](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-number-of-ways-to-reach-the-k-th-stair/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to find the number of distinct ways to reach the k-th stair if we can either take one step or two steps at a time. This is a common dynamic programming problem where we can break down the problem into simpler subproblems. 

To reach the k-th stair:
- If we take a single step to reach stair k, we must have been on stair k-1 first.
- If we take a double step to reach stair k, we must have been on stair k-2 first.

Thus, the total number of ways to reach the k-th stair can be defined as a recurrence relation:
- `ways(k) = ways(k-1) + ways(k-2)`

We can establish base cases:
- `ways(0) = 1` (there is one way to stay at the ground level, doing nothing)
- `ways(1) = 1` (there is only one way to reach the first stair: a single step)

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Define the recurrence relation**: Use an array or two variables to store the maximum number of ways to reach `k-1` and `k-2` stairs.
2. **Iterate**: Fill the values up to `k` using the established recurrence relation.
3. **Space Optimization**: Instead of keeping an entire array, we can keep just the last two computed values since each value only depends on the previous two.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(k), as we need to compute the values from 2 up to k.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a constant amount of space for storing the last two values.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countWays(int k) {
        if (k == 0) return 1;
        if (k == 1) return 1;
        
        int prev2 = 1; // ways to reach k-2
        int prev1 = 1; // ways to reach k-1
        int current;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= k; ++i) {
            current = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }
        return current;
    }
