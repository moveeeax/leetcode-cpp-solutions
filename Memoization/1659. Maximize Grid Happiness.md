# **[Maximize Grid Happiness](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-grid-happiness/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves maximizing the overall happiness in a grid-like structure by placing two different types of residents: "A" and "B". Each type of resident contributes differently to happiness based on their placement and the surrounding residents. We need to strategically place these residents to achieve the highest total happiness score, balancing their positive and negative contributions based on rules given in the problem statement.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding Happiness Contribution**: Each type of resident has a specific contribution score based on their neighbors, referred to as happiness scores. For instance, "A" residents increase happiness based on the number of "B" they neighbor and vice versa.
2. **State Representation**: The state can be represented as the count of "A" and "B" residents placed in the grid, as well as their happiness scores.
3. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive method (backtracking) to explore all possible configurations of residents in the grid.
4. **Memoization**: To avoid recalculating the scores for already examined states, we can store the results of previous configurations.
5. **Base Case and Recursive Step**: In each recursive call, we will check if we have filled the grid. If so, we will calculate and return the total happiness. If not, we will place either "A" or "B" (if there is room) and recursively call the function for the next position.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(3^(M*N)) where M is rows and N is columns due to the exponential nature of state exploration in the grid.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(M*N) for the recursion stack.
