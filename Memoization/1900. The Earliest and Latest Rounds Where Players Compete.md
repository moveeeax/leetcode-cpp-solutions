# **[The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-earliest-and-latest-rounds-where-players-compete/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around a single-elimination tournament where players compete in pairs across multiple rounds until a winner emerges. The primary focus is to identify the earliest and latest rounds where two specific players compete against each other. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding Rounds**: In each round, players face off in pairs. If the tournament starts with `n` players, the first round has `n/2` matches. 
2. **Identifying Players**: The goal is to find the rounds in which players `p1` and `p2` compete.
3. **Simulation of Rounds**: We need to simulate the tournament from the initial state of players until we find the rounds they encounter:
   - Track the rounds where `p1` and `p2` are placed in the same match.
   - Since players are indexed from `1` to `n`, and matches are determined by halving the indices logically, we need to continue this process until the two players meet.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the number of players. This arises because the number of rounds is logarithmic relative to the initial number of players (due to halving the player base each round).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

        int round = 0;
        int earliest = 0, latest = 0;

        while (p1_curr != p2_curr) {
            round++;
            p1_curr = (p1_curr + 1) / 2;
            p2_curr = (p2_curr + 1) / 2;
        }
        earliest = round;

        // The latest round can only be the round before elimination
        round = 0;
        p1_curr = p1;
        p2_curr = p2;
        while (p1_curr != p2_curr) {
            round++;
            // Move each player to their next round match
            if ((p1_curr + 1) / 2 == (p2_curr + 1) / 2 && (round + 1) <= n / 2) {
                latest = round + 1; // they meet in the next round
            }
            p1_curr = (p1_curr + 1) / 2;
            p2_curr = (p2_curr + 1) / 2;
        }

        return {earliest, latest};
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `EarliestAndLatestRounds.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
