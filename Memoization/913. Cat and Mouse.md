# **[Cat and Mouse](https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-mouse/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we have two players: a cat and a mouse, positioned on a one-dimensional path represented by a graph with certain distances. The mouse is trying to reach a hole (position 0) while the cat is chasing it. The game proceeds in turns, and depending on the distances between them, one can reach the hole or catch the mouse. The outcome of the game is to determine who wins: the mouse, the cat, or if it's a draw.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **State Representation**: 
   - We can represent the states with three variables: cat's position, mouse's position, and the turn (0 for the mouse and 1 for the cat).
   - If the cat reaches the mouse, it captures the mouse.
   - If the mouse reaches the hole, the mouse wins.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We'll use dynamic programming (DP) to remember the outcomes of previously computed states, which helps us avoid redundant calculations.
   - The DP table will store the results for each position of the cat and mouse and keep track of whose turn it is.

3. **Recursion with Memoization**:
   - We can define a recursive function that evaluates the winner based on the current positions of the cat and mouse and whose turn it is.
   - If it‚Äôs the mouse's turn, it will try to optimize its position moving towards the hole. If it‚Äôs the cat's turn, it tries to minimize the distance to catch the mouse.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If the cat's position equals the mouse's position, the cat wins (return 2).
   - If the mouse reaches the hole (position 0), it wins (return 1).

5. **Transition**:
   - We try all possible moves for the current player and determine the winner based on their optimal strategy.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2 * N) where N is the maximum distance (positions) in the game, due to nested loops in the recursive calls.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N^2) for the memoization table.
