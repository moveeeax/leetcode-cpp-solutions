# **[Count Artifacts That Can Be Extracted](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-artifacts-that-can-be-extracted/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine how many types of artifacts can be extracted based on the given information about various artifacts, their corresponding values, and the respective artefacts they can form. Each artifact is represented by integers where each integer corresponds to a unique type. The input consists of two lists: one for the value of each artifact and the second for the relationships between these artifacts. The goal is to extract combinations of artifacts based on a given list of input types.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: We'll first interpret the list of artifacts and their relationships as a graph, where each artifact forms a node, and the relationships between them form edges.
2. **Depth First Search (DFS)**: To find the connected components in the graph, we can employ a DFS approach. Each time we initiate a DFS from an unvisited node, it will reveal a new connected component, which means we have found a new type of artifact we can extract collectively.
3. **Count Extractable Artifacts**: For each connected component we find, we can extract all the artifacts associated with that component.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the number of artifacts, and m is the number of relationships since we potentially visit each artifact and each relationship once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for storing the graph representation (adjacency list) and the set for visited nodes.
