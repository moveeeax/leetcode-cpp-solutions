# **[Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to distribute candies to children standing in a line based on their ratings. Each child must receive at least one candy, and children with a higher rating than their immediate neighbors must receive more candies than those neighbors. The goal is to minimize the total number of candies distributed to the children.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we can utilize a two-pass greedy algorithm:
1. **First Pass (Left to Right)**: Traverse the `ratings` array from left to right. For each child, if their rating is higher than the rating of the previous child, assign them one more candy than the previous child.
2. **Second Pass (Right to Left)**: Traverse the array from right to left. For each child, if their rating is higher than the rating of the next child, ensure that they have more candies than the next child by updating their candy count accordingly.
3. Finally, sum up all the candies distributed to get the minimum number of candies needed.

This algorithm ensures that at every step, the conditions of the problem are met while using a minimal number of candies.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of children (length of the ratings array), since we make two passes through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the candies assigned to each child.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size();
        vector<int> candies(n, 1); // Initialize each child with 1 candy

        // Forward pass
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }

        // Backward pass
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }
        }

        // Sum up the candies
        return accumulate(candies.begin(), candies.end(), 0);
    }

            }
        }

        // Sum up the candies
        return accumulate(candies.begin(), candies.end(), 0);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> ratings = {1, 0, 2};
    cout << solution.candy(ratings) << endl; // Expected output: 5

    ratings = {1, 2, 2};
    cout << solution.candy(ratings) << endl; // Expected output: 4

    return 0;
