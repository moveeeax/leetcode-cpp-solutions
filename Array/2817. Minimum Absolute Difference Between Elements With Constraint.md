# **[Minimum Absolute Difference Between Elements With Constraint](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-between-elements-with-constraint/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires finding the minimum absolute difference between pairs of elements in an array, but with certain constraints based on a given value `limit`. Specifically, we can compare differences only between the same value or elements that differ by at most `limit`. To tackle this efficiently, we need to iterate over the array while keeping track of the previously seen elements, and simultaneously check their differences against the current element. This ensures we only calculate the differences that meet the specified condition.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Array**: First, we'll sort the array of integers. Sorting will help us efficiently find the minimum absolute difference within the required constraints because we can simply check neighboring elements for their differences.
  
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: We can use a two-pointer technique or a sliding window. As we iterate through the array, we maintain a window of elements that are within the `limit` of the current element. This will allow us to find pairs that conform to the constraint.

3. **Calculating Minimum Difference**: For each element in the sorted array, we will check against elements within the window to find the minimum absolute difference.

4. **Edge Cases**: We need to handle cases where `n` is less than 2 since no pairs would exist to form a difference. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the array.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are not using any extra space that scales with input size, other than a few variables.
