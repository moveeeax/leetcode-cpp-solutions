# **[Find the Sum of the Power of All Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-sum-of-the-power-of-all-subsequences/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to calculate the sum of the powers of all possible subsequences of a given integer array. The "power" of a subsequence that consists of elements from the array is defined as the bitwise OR of those elements. To tackle this problem effectively, we need to consider the contribution of each individual element across all subsequences that include it. The key insight is to note how many subsequences contain each individual element and compute their respective powers efficiently.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Contribution**: Each element contributes to many subsequences. For an element at position `i`, to calculate how many subsequences it appears in:
   - It can be combined with any subset of the elements before it.
   - It can also combine with any subset of elements after it.
2. **Subsequence Calculation**: The total subsequences that include element `arr[i]` is equivalent to `2^(count_before) * 2^(count_after)`, where `count_before` is the number of elements before `i`, and `count_after` is the number of elements after `i`.
3. **Power Calculation Using OR**: Calculate the bitwise OR for each position and multiply it by the number of subsequences it belongs to, then sum these contributions together to get the final result.
4. **Iterate and Sum**: Finally, iterate through each element to calculate and accumulate its total contribution to the overall sum.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we traverse the array once to calculate contributions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since no additional space proportional to input size is used.

            contribution = (contribution * pow(2, n - i - 1)) % mod;
            totalSum = (totalSum + contribution) % mod;
        }
