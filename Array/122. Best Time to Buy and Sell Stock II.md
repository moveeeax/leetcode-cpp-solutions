# **[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires maximizing profits from stock prices over a series of days, where multiple transactions can be made. Buying a stock can be followed by selling it on a later day, and the key is to recognize that if there‚Äôs an upward trend in stock prices from one day to the next, we should buy on the previous day and sell on the next day to maximize profit. The goal is to calculate the total profit that can be gained by buying and selling the stocks at optimal times.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the stock prices and accumulate profits whenever there is a price increase from one day to the next:
1. Start with a total profit initialized to zero.
2. Loop through the stock prices from the first day to the day before the last day.
3. On each day, check if the price has increased the next day:
   - If yes, calculate the profit as the difference between the two prices and add it to the total profit.
4. Continue this until we have processed all the days.
5. Return the total profit as the result.

This approach is optimal because we are making a single pass through the list of prices, ensuring that we capture all profitable transactions.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of days (length of the prices array).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a constant amount of extra space for the profit variable.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int totalProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                totalProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return totalProfit;
    }
