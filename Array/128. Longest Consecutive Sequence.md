# **[Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array of integers. The sequence must consist of consecutive integers where no integer can be repeated. To solve the problem efficiently, we need a strategy that avoids excessive computations and uses a data structure that supports fast lookups. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We will use a `unordered_set` to store unique elements from the input array. This allows for O(1) average time complexity for lookups.
2. For each element in the array, we will check if it can be the start of a consecutive sequence. We do this by ensuring the element minus one does not exist in the set, indicating that it cannot be part of a longer sequence.
3. If it is indeed a starting number, we will initiate a count for the sequence and keep incrementing it by checking for the presence of the next consecutive numbers (i.e., the current number plus one).
4. We will keep track of the maximum length found during this process.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - where n is the number of elements in the array since every element will be processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - for storing the unique elements in the hash set.

            // Only check for streaks starting from the beginning of a sequence
            if (numSet.find(num - 1) == numSet.end()) {
                int currentNum = num;
                int currentStreak = 1;

                while (numSet.find(currentNum + 1) != numSet.end()) {
                    currentNum++;
                    currentStreak++;
                }

                longestStreak = max(longestStreak, currentStreak);
            }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `LongestConsecutiveSequence.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `LongestConsecutiveSequence` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class LongestConsecutiveSequence {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int longestStreak = 0;

        for (int num : numSet) {
            // Only check for streaks starting from the beginning of a sequence
            if (numSet.find(num - 1) == numSet.end()) {
                int currentNum = num;
                int currentStreak = 1;

                while (numSet.find(currentNum + 1) != numSet.end()) {
                    currentNum++;
                    currentStreak++;
                }

                longestStreak = max(longestStreak, currentStreak);
            }
        }

        return longestStreak;
    }
};

int main() {
    LongestConsecutiveSequence solution;
    vector<int> nums = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2};
    int result = solution.longestConsecutive(nums);
    cout << "Length of Longest Consecutive Sequence: " << result << endl; // Expected output: 4
    return 0;
}
