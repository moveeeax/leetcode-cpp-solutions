# **[Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves maximizing the number of fruits collected from a given list, where you can only select up to two types of fruits (represented as integers) at any given time while traversing the fruit basket. The key is to efficiently track and manage the different types of fruits as we iterate through the list, ensuring we never exceed the limit of two types.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The best approach for this problem is to use the sliding window technique, which allows us to dynamically adjust our window of valid fruit types as we iterate through the array. We will keep track of the count of each fruit currently in the window and adjust the window when we encounter a third type of fruit.

1. **Initialization**: Set up two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the window, a hashmap or unordered_map to count the frequency of each fruit, and a variable to store the maximum number of fruits collected.

2. **Expand the Window**: Starting with the `right` pointer at the beginning of the array, add fruits to the count until we have more than two types of fruits. Each time we include a fruit, we record it in our count structure.

3. **Contract the Window**: When the count exceeds two fruit types, increment the `left` pointer to contract the window until we are back to two types. This involves decreasing the count of the leftmost fruit and potentially removing it from our count structure if its count drops to zero.

4. **Update the Maximum**: After each valid window defined by the `left` and `right` pointers, calculate the size of the current window and compare it to the maximum size found so far.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, return the largest size recorded.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input list. Each fruit is processed at most twice (once added and once removed).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the space used for the counts can be capped at a maximum of two, given that we are only interested in two types.
