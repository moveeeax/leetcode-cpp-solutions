# **[Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-speed-to-arrive-on-time/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum speed (in integer km/h) required to arrive at a destination on time, given the distances between consecutive destinations and the total time allowed for the trip. This involves balancing the time spent on each segment of the journey with the speeds, ensuring that we do not exceed the allotted time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Inputs**:
   - An integer `dist[]` that represents the distances between each consecutive stop.
   - A double `hour` representing the total time allowed to complete the trip.
  
2. **Binary Search**:
   - We can utilize binary search to efficiently find the minimum speed. The minimum possible speed is `1` (the speed can't be lower than this), and the maximum speed can be the maximum distance divided by `hour` (as an upper limit to reach on time).
   - We will calculate the time required for each distance at the current candidate speed, and accumulate these times.
  
3. **Calculation of Time**:
   - For each distance `d` in `dist`, the time to travel that distance at the current speed `speed` can be calculated as `time = ceil(d / speed)`.
   - We need to ensure the total time taken does not exceed `hour`.
  
4. **Termination Condition**:
   - If the total time with the current speed is within `hour`, we search for a potentially smaller speed; otherwise, we increase the speed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log(maxDist)), where `n` is the number of distances and `maxDist` is the maximum distance in the array. This is due to the binary search combined with the time calculation for each speed.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a few extra variables to track time and speed.

```cpp
class MinimumSpeedToArriveOnTime {
public:
    int minSpeedOnTime(vector<int>& dist, double hour) {
        int left = 1, right = 1e7; // speed limits
        int result = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int speed = left + (right - left) / 2;

            for (int i = 0; i < dist.size(); i++) {
                timeTaken += (i == dist.size() - 1) ? (dist[i] + speed - 1) / speed : ceil((double)dist[i] / speed);
            }

            if (timeTaken > hour) {
                left = speed + 1;
            } else {
                result = speed;
                right = speed - 1;

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `MinimumSpeedToArriveOnTime.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `MinimumSpeedToArriveOnTime` class inside `main()`**  
3. **Include necessary headers**: `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <cmath>`  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**: Read input, create an object, call `minSpeedOnTime`, then print the result.  
5. **Compile and run the program**
