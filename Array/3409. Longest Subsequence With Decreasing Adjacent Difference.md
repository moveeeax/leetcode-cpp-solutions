# **[Longest Subsequence With Decreasing Adjacent Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-decreasing-adjacent-difference/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are given an array `A` of integers and our task is to find the length of the longest subsequence such that the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the subsequence is less than or equal to `K`. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

The problem emphasizes finding a subsequence with decreasing adjacent differences, making this a nuanced version of a classic dynamic programming problem, where we will preserve the order of elements while allowing selective skipping.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We will maintain an array `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`.
2. **Initialization**: For all indices `i`, `dp[i]` will be initialized to `1` since the minimum possible subsequence length for each element is just the element itself.
3. **Iterate Through the Array**: 
   - For each element `A[i]`, we will check all previous elements `A[j]` (where `j < i`):
     - If the absolute difference `|A[i] - A[j]|` is less than or equal to `K`, we can extend the subsequence ending with `A[j]` by including `A[i]`.
     - We update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, which represents the new subsequence length formed by including `A[i]`.
4. **Result**: The answer will be the maximum value in the `dp` array, which is the length of the longest valid subsequence.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) because for each element we may potentially check against every previous element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the `dp` array storing lengths of subsequences.
