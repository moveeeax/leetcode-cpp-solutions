# **[Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-lines-to-represent-a-line-chart/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of lines needed to connect a series of points in 2D space, where each point is defined by its x and y coordinates. A line can be drawn between two points if they form a straight line, which can be defined using the slope. If two lines connecting three points have the same slope or are collinear, they can be replaced with a single line. 

This necessitates calculating the slopes between consecutive points and counting transitions where the slope changes.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Points**: Start by sorting the points based on their x-coordinates. If two points have the same x-coordinate, sort by their y-coordinate.
2. **Calculate Slopes**: After sorting, compute the slope between each consecutive pair of points. The slope can be represented as a fraction (dy, dx), and since we need to avoid division, we store slopes as pairs of integers (dy, dx) normalized.
3. **Count Unique Changes in Slopes**: Initialize a counter and iterate through the sorted points while tracking the current slope. Each time a new unique slope is encountered, increment the counter.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the points. The slope computation is O(n), making the overall complexity O(n log n).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the counter and temporary variables, as we only store a fixed number of values.
