# **[Dungeon Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves navigating a character through a dungeon represented as a 2D grid. The goal is to ensure the character can survive the dungeon's encounters with monsters (which may deduct health) and reach the princess at the bottom-right cell of the grid. The character starts with a certain amount of health, and we need to find the minimal initial health required to guarantee survival.

The dungeon grid consists of positive integers (which add health) and negative integers (which subtract health). We need to calculate the minimum health requirement at the start to ensure that the character can travel from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid without dying (health dropping to zero or below).

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Dynamic Programming Table (DP)**: We will use a dynamic programming approach to build a DP table where each cell represents the minimum health needed at that point considering the worst-case scenario of both paths to the cell (from the top and from the left).
  
2. **Reverse Traversal**: We'll fill in the DP table by starting from the bottom-right corner of the dungeon moving towards the top-left. This reverse traversal allows us to decide the health needed at each cell based on the health needed in the cells it can reach (down and right).

3. **Health Calculation**: For each cell in the grid:
   - If the cell is the bottom-right corner, we set the minimum health needed based on whether the value is positive or negative.
   - For other cells, we need to consider the minimum health needed to reach either right or down from that cell. The goal is to ensure that after moving through that cell, the player must end up with at least health `1`.

4. **Final Result**: After filling in the DP table, the value at the top-left corner will be the minimum initial health required to safely survive and reach the princess.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the dungeon grid since we're visiting each cell exactly once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for storing the DP table, but this can be optimized to O(n) since we only need the values from the current and previous rows at all times.
