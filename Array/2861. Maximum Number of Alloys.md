# **[Maximum Number of Alloys](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-alloys/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of alloys that can be created from a given set of metals. Each metal has an associated quantity, and it also has a specific amount of alloys it can produce. We need to effectively combine these metals to maximize the output of alloys.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach:

1. **Define the Range**: First, we need to identify the range of possible maximum alloys that can be produced. The minimum potential output is 0, and the maximum output can be constrained by the total amount of raw materials available.

2. **Binary Search**: We will conduct a binary search between these two bounds to find the maximum number of alloys we can produce:
    - For a given midpoint in our search range, we check if it's possible to create that many alloys.
    - This is done by iterating through each metal and determining whether the available quantity divided by its alloy requirement is sufficient for the current midpoint. If total metals support the mid-point amount of alloys, continue to search in the higher half; otherwise, search in the lower half.

3. **Check Feasibility**: For each midpoint, a helper function will be used to check the feasibility by summing how many alloys can be produced from each metal and comparing it to the number of alloys needed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m log(n)), where m is the number of metals and n is the total possible maximum alloys. This is because we have to check each midpoint for every metal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because we are using only a few additional variables for computation.
