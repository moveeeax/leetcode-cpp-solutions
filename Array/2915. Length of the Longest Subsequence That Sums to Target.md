# **[Length of the Longest Subsequence That Sums to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-the-longest-subsequence-that-sums-to-target/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires finding the longest subsequence of a given array that sums to a specified target value. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. Our goal is to maximize the length of the subsequence that exactly equals the target sum. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Array**: Begin by sorting the input array in descending order. This allows us to consider larger elements first, making it easier to hit the target without overshooting, as adding larger numbers to a sum can quickly exceed the target.
  
2. **Greedy Selection**: Iterate through the sorted array and keep adding elements to a cumulative sum until adding another element would surpass the target. This approach works because using larger elements first helps in reaching the target more effectively while maintaining the potential to hit it precisely with smaller elements.

3. **Counting Valid Elements**: Each time we succeed in adding an element to our cumulative sum, we increase our count of the elements in the subsequence. The process continues until we can't add any more numbers without exceeding the target.

4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the input array is empty or where all elements are larger than the target, as these situations should return 0.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the size of the input array. The subsequent iteration is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are not using any additional space that scales with input size.
