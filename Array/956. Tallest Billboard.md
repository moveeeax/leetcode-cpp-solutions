# **[Tallest Billboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/tallest-billboard/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to build two sets of fences of equal height using given lengths of rods. The goal is to maximize the total height of these fences. Given pairs of rod lengths, we can think of each pair as contributing positively to the height if they are used in both fences and negatively if they are in only one fence. The challenge is to find a way to partition the rods into two valid fences that balance each other out while maximizing their height.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We can use a DP table to track the maximum height of the fence configurations as we iterate through the rods. The idea is to maintain the balance we can achieve with our current set of rods.
2. **State Representation**: Define a DP state `dp[i][j]` where `i` stands for the index of the rod we're considering, and `j` represents the balance of heights between the two sets. We keep track of heights in relation to a midpoint, which helps avoid using negative indices.
3. **Transition**:
   - When considering a new rod length `x`, we can either:
     - Not use it, which means our balance remains unchanged.
     - Use it in both fences, which increases our total height.
     - Use it in only one fence, which modifies our balance.
4. **Base Conditions**: `dp[0][0]` would be initialized to 0 because with no rods, the height is zero and the balance is also zero.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(2000 * n), where n is the number of rods because of the balance from -1000 to +1000 (total range of 2000).
- **Space Complexity**: O(2000), since that's the size of the balance dimension within the DP array.

public:

        unordered_map<int, int> dp; // balance to max height
        dp[0] = 0; // zero balance corresponds to zero height

            for (auto& [balance, height] : dp) {
                // Case 1: Use the rod in both sides (increases height)
                new_dp[balance] = max(new_dp[balance], height + x);
                // Case 2: Use the rod only on the left side (decreases balance by x)
                new_dp[balance + x] = max(new_dp[balance + x], height);
                // Case 3: Use the rod only on the right side (increases the balance by x)
                if (balance >= x) {
                    new_dp[balance - x] = max(new_dp[balance - x], height);
                }
            }
            
            dp = new_dp; // move to the next state of dp
        }
        
        return dp[0]; // the maximum height at zero balance
