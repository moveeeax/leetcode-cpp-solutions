# **[Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-coins-you-can-get/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of coins that can be obtained from a series of piles represented by an array. Each pile has a specific number of coins, and we can perform a sequence of operations to take coins from these piles, provided we share some with the opponent. 

To maximize our coins while ensuring that we follow the picking constraints, we need to adopt a strategic approach to select coins from the largest piles and appropriately decide how many coins to take based on the constraints imposed by rounds of picking.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Piles**: First, sort the array of piles in ascending order.
2. **Divide the Piles**: We need to determine how many piles we can consider in terms of the total number of coins we can take.
3. **Calculate Maximum Coins**:
   - We will start taking coins from the highest piles while ensuring we take fewer coins than the opponent in the same turn.
   - In each turn, we have to compare the number of coins we can take and choose strategically from the largest remaining pile until we exhaust the options.
4. **Iterative Sum**: Sum up the counted coins to find the total.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of piles due to sorting.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are sorting in-place and using a constant amount of extra space.

```cpp
class MaximumNumberOfCoins {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& piles) {
        sort(piles.begin(), piles.end());
        int n = piles.size();
        int max_coins = 0;
        int count = n / 3;

        // Start from the end of the sorted piles and take coins
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= count; i -= 2) {
            max_coins += piles[i];
        }

        return max_coins; 
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `maximum_number_of_coins.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `MaximumNumberOfCoins` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class MaximumNumberOfCoins {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& piles) {
        sort(piles.begin(), piles.end());
        int n = piles.size();
        int max_coins = 0;
        int count = n / 3;

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= count; i -= 2) {
            max_coins += piles[i];
        }

        return max_coins; 
    }
};

int main() {
    MaximumNumberOfCoins solution;
    vector<int> piles = {2, 4, 1, 2, 7, 8}; // Sample input
    cout << "Maximum number of coins: " << solution.maxCoins(piles) << endl; // Expected output: 9
    return 0;
}
