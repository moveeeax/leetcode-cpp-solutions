# **[Maximum Running Time of N Computers](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-running-time-of-n-computers/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves maximizing the running time of `n` computers that each can run a specific time before needing to be charged again. We must distribute the total battery across all computers effectively so that they can run for the maximum possible length of time. This is similar to a load balancing problem, where we distribute resources (battery) among consumers (computers).

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, the key steps are:
1. **Sorting the batteries**: Start by arranging the battery capacities in descending order. This allows us to allocate the most significant battery to computers first, ensuring that we leverage the maximum available energy for longer duration.
2. **Binary Search**: We will apply binary search to determine the maximum running time (`T`). We will search for the maximum possible time from `1` to the total battery capacity divided by the number of computers.
3. **Check Feasibility**: For a mid-point time during the binary search, check if it's possible to run all computers for that duration. To do this, verify if the total battery can fulfill the demand of `n * T`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log(sum of batteries)), where `n` is the number of computers, and we're doing a binary search on the time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only store a few variables regardless of the number of computers.

                left = mid; // We can possibly increase running time
            } else {
                right = mid - 1; // Otherwise, decrease running time
            }
