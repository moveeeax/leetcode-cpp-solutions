# **[Total Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-hamming-distance/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The Hamming distance between two integers is defined as the number of positions at which their corresponding bits are different. The goal of this problem is to calculate the total Hamming distance between all pairs of integers in a given array. For example, given an array of integers, we want to count how many times all pairs of integers differ in their binary representation.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize the properties of bits. Instead of comparing every possible pair of integers (which would lead to O(n^2) complexity), we can analyze each bit position individually. The approach can be summarized as follows:
1. For each bit position (from 0 to 31, assuming 32-bit integers):
   - Count how many integers in the array have a `1` at that position (`countOnes`).
   - The number of integers with a `0` at that position can be computed as `n - countOnes` (where `n` is the size of the array).
   - The Hamming distance contributions from this bit position for all pairs can be calculated as `countOnes * (n - countOnes)` because for each pair formed by one `1` and one `0`, their bits at this position differ. 
   
2. Sum these contributions over all bit positions to get the final total Hamming distance.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(32n) which simplifies to O(n) since the number of bits is constant (32).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space for counters.
