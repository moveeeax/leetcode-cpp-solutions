# **[Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find a number in a list that appears exactly once while every other number appears three times. The key challenge is implementing an efficient algorithm that can isolate this single number through each possible occurrence of the other numbers.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The algorithm employs a bit manipulation technique using bitwise operations. The method tracks the digits in binary representation for each number's occurrence, counting how many times each bit has been set across the list. With numbers appearing three times, we'll reconstruct the unique number by checking the bits that aren't counted in groups of three.

1. Use two variables, `ones` and `twos`, to keep track of the bits that have appeared once and twice respectively.
  
2. Iterate through each number in the input array:
   - Update the `twos` variable with the bits that are set in both `ones` and the current number.
   - Update `ones` variable with the current number while ensuring to not include bits already captured by `twos`.
   - Form a mask of bits that appeared three times and should be cleared from both `ones` and `twos`.

3. Finally, `ones` will have the unique number that appears once.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array, since we do a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space for the `ones`, `twos`, and `threesome` variables.

public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ones = 0, twos = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            twos |= ones & num; // Update twos with bits that are in ones and current number
            ones ^= num;        // Update ones with the current number
            int threesome = ones & twos; // Identify bits that appeared three times
            ones &= ~threesome; // Remove these bits from ones
            twos &= ~threesome; // Remove these bits from twos
        }
        return ones; // Only the unique number will remain in ones
    }
