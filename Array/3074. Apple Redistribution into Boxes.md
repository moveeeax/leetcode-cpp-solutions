# **[Apple Redistribution into Boxes](https://leetcode.com/problems/apple-redistribution-into-boxes/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around redistributing apples among a number of boxes, ensuring that each box contains a similar quantity of apples. It challenges us to determine the minimum number of moves required to achieve a nearly equal distribution across the boxes. Given the potential for variances in the number of apples each box can hold, the task is to find the most efficient method of redistribution using the least number of moves.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Calculate Total Apples**: First, we determine the total number of apples across all boxes.
2. **Determine Target Distribution**: Identify how many apples each box should ideally contain, considering total apples and the number of boxes.
3. **Redistribute**: Iterate through each box, calculate how many apples need to be moved to/from that box to achieve the target distribution.
4. **Count Moves**: For each box, if it has excess apples (more than the target), we calculate how many moves it takes to make adjustments. Conversely, for boxes with deficits, we check how many apples need to be received. Keep a count of the total number of moves required to balance the distribution.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of boxes since we iterate through the array of boxes once to calculate the total apples and the subsequent moves.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few additional variables to store sums and counts; no extra space is required that scales with input size.

        }
        int target = total_apples / boxes.size();
        int moves = 0;
        
        for (int apples : boxes) {
            if (apples > target) {
                moves += apples - target;
            }
        }
