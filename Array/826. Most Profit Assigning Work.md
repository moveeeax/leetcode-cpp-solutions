# **[Most Profit Assigning Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained by assigning work to workers. Each worker has a specified maximum difficulty they can handle, and each job has a defined difficulty along with a profit associated with it. The goal is to assign jobs to workers such that the sum of profits for the completed jobs is maximized, considering the workers' limitations.

Here's a breakdown of the components involved:
- Each worker can only take one job, and that job must have a difficulty not exceeding the worker's capability.
- Each job can only be assigned to one worker.
- If a worker does not have any work assigned, their profit contribution is zero.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting**: Start by sorting both the jobs (by their difficulty) and workers (by their capability).
2. **Profit Mapping**: Create a mapping of the maximum profit for each job difficulty, ensuring that each succeeding maximum profit incorporates the maximum achievable profit up to that job's difficulty.
3. **Profit Calculation**: For each worker, determine what the maximum profit they can earn is based on their capability and return these profits.

#### Steps:
- Sort the jobs by their difficulty and create a profit vector during this process to allow easy access to the maximum profit that can be achieved for jobs of varying difficulties.
- Maintain a simple iteration process to calculate the maximum profits available up to each job.
- For each worker, find the best job they can do (using binary search to improve efficiency).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of jobs and m is the number of workers. Sorting both arrays takes O(n log n + m log m) and searching for the maximum profit takes O(m log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store the maximum profit for each job's difficulty.
