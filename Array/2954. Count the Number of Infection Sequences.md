# **[Count the Number of Infection Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-infection-sequences/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to count the number of unique sequences of infections that can occur among a group of `n` buildings represented as a string consisting of two characters: `'0'` for a healthy building, and `'1'` for an infected building. An infected building can infect its neighboring healthy buildings, and we are to simulate the possible infection sequences that can occur until all buildings are infected. 

The key observation is that the transition from healthy to infected can happen in any contiguous sequence of healthy buildings surrounded by infected buildings. Hence, the total unique sequences is determined by the arrangement of these healthy sequences when the initial infections spread.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Initial Infected Buildings**: Identify the positions of all `'1'`s in the string. 
2. **Identify Segments of Healthy Buildings**: Between the `'1'`s, count the segments of contiguous `'0'`s.
3. **Compute the Result**: The number of unique infection sequences will be determined by the counts of these segments; essentially, it depends on how many '0' segments exist and how they can be utilized to infect their neighbors.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we need to traverse the string to count the number of segments and characters of interest.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space for our calculations.

                if (healthyCount > 0) {
                    totalCount *= (healthyCount + 1);

            } else {
                healthyCount++;
            }
        }

        if (healthyCount > 0) {
            totalCount *= (healthyCount + 1);

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `CountInfectionSequences.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `CountInfectionSequences` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class CountInfectionSequences {
public:
    int countInfectionSequences(string buildings) {
        int n = buildings.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        int totalCount = 1;
        int healthyCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (buildings[i] == '1') {
                if (healthyCount > 0) {
                    totalCount *= (healthyCount + 1);
                }
                healthyCount = 0;
            } else {
                healthyCount++;
            }
        }

        if (healthyCount > 0) {
            totalCount *= (healthyCount + 1);
        }

        return totalCount;
    }
};

int main() {
    CountInfectionSequences solution;
    string buildings;
    
    cout << "Enter the string of buildings (e.g. 001100): ";
    cin >> buildings;
    
    int result = solution.countInfectionSequences(buildings);
    cout << "The number of infection sequences is: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
