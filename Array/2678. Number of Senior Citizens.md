# **[Number of Senior Citizens](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-senior-citizens/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of senior citizens from a given set of input data representing people's ages and status. Each person's data is presented as a string consisting of two parts: their age (two digits) and a character indicating whether they are a senior citizen ('S' for Senior and 'N' for Non-Senior). The main challenge involves correctly parsing these strings and maintaining the count of senior citizens based on the specified condition, where a person is considered a senior citizen if their age is 60 or above.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Read the input, which consists of a list of strings. Each string contains age and status information.
2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of senior citizens.
3. For each string in the list, check if the person's age is greater than or equal to 60. If true, increment the counter.
4. Return the total count.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of people in the input data. Each person's status string is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a fixed amount of additional space for the counter.

        int count = 0;
        for (const string& detail : details) {
            if (detail.substr(11, 2) >= "60") {
                count++;

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `number_of_senior_citizens.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countSeniors(vector<string>& details) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const string& detail : details) {
            if (detail.substr(11, 2) >= "60") {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
