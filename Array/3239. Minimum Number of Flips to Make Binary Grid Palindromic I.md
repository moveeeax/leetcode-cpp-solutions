# **[Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic I](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-make-binary-grid-palindromic-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The target of this problem is to convert a binary grid (a 2D array of 0s and 1s) into a palindromic grid with the minimum number of flips. A grid is palindromic if it looks identical when reflected across both horizontal and vertical axes. Therefore, for every cell in the upper half of the grid, we need to ensure it matches its corresponding cell in the lower half, as well as in the left half of the grid compared to the right half.

To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of symmetry and calculate how many flips are required for each symmetrical pair of cells.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding Symmetry**: For a grid of `n` rows and `m` columns, the symmetry means that:
   - For each cell at position `(i, j)`, it pairs with
     - `(n-1-i, j)` (vertical reflection)
     - `(i, m-1-j)` (horizontal reflection)
     - `(n-1-i, m-1-j)` (both reflections)

2. **Counting Flips**: For each unique position `(i, j)` (taking half of the necessary reflections into account), we need to count how many of the cells are `0` and how many are `1`. 
    - For each unique symmetrical group of cells, we will take the minimum flips needed to make all of them `0` or all of them `1` since the palindromic condition would require them to match.

3. **Final Calculation**: Sum up the flips across all symmetrical pairs to get the total number of minimum flips required to achieve a palindromic binary grid.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the grid. We scan through each cell and its symmetrical counterparts at most a few times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
