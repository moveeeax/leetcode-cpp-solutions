# **[Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-cutting-cake-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to cut a cake where we have constraints involving specific positions on both the horizontal and vertical axes. Each cut has a cost based on its position, specifically, it's proportional to the length of the cake that will be split by the cut. This means that if we visualize the problem, cutting the cake can be approached by treating the costs associated with each possible cut as weights in a grid-like structure.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach where we keep track of potential costs of making vertical and horizontal cuts. We'll maintain arrays where:
- `horizontalCuts` stores the positions of the horizontal cuts sorted in ascending order.
- `verticalCuts` stores the positions of the vertical cuts in a similar manner.

To find the minimum cost of making the cuts:
1. Start by adding the edges of the cake (0 and the respective length) to the cut positions.
2. Sort both the arrays to facilitate calculating the segments formed by the cuts.
3. Calculate the maximum cost incurred by each segment:
   - The height of segments is determined by vertical cuts.
   - The width of segments is based on horizontal cuts.
4. The result is derived from the total cost which is accumulated based on the sizes of these segments.

This is done in a way that focuses on minimizing the incurred cost through optimal cutting order and necessary evaluations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O((m + n) log(m + n)), where m is the number of horizontal cuts and n is the number of vertical cuts (due to sorting).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using constant space aside from input storage.
