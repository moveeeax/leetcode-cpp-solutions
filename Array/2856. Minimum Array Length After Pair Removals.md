# **[Minimum Array Length After Pair Removals](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-array-length-after-pair-removals/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves reducing an array by repeatedly removing pairs of identical elements until no more pairs can be removed. The goal is to determine the minimum possible length of the array after all such pair removals. The core idea is that elements can be reduced down to their odd occurrences: if an element appears an even number of times, it can completely disappear, while if it appears an odd number of times, one instance will remain.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a frequency map (or unordered map) to count the occurrences of each element in the array. The steps are as follows:

1. Create a frequency map to count how often each element appears in the array.
2. Iterate through the frequency map, and for each unique element count, determine the number of occurrences that will remain:
   - If the count is even, it contributes 0 to the remaining elements.
   - If the count is odd, it contributes 1 to the remaining elements.
3. Sum the contributions of all unique elements to get the final answer.

This approach is efficient as counting the occurrences and summing up the contributions can be done in linear time relative to the size of the array.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array since we need to traverse the array to build the frequency map and another loop to compute the result.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique elements in the array (in the worst case, all elements are unique).
