# **[Word Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to find all the words in a list that are "universal" with respect to another list of words, where a word from the first list is considered universal if it contains all the letters required by each word in the second list, accounting for their maximum frequency. The challenge is to efficiently compare the frequencies of characters across both lists.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To determine if a word in the first list is a universal word with respect to the second list, we can take the following steps:

1. **Frequency Count**: First, compute a frequency count of all letters required by any word in the second list. This involves iterating over each word in the second list and counting the maximum occurrences of each letter across these words.

2. **Check Words Against Requirement**: For each word in the first list, compute its frequency count and check if it contains at least the maximum required frequency for every letter that needs to be present.

3. **Store Results**: If a word fulfills the requirement, add it to the results list.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m + l * 26), where n is the number of words in the first list, m is the average length of these words, and l is the number of words in the second list. The 26 comes from the English alphabet size, which is used for frequency counting.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the frequency array size is constant (only 26 letters).

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `word_subsets.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
