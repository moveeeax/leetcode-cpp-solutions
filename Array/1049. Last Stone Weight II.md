# **[Last Stone Weight II](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem consists of a group of stones with given weights and the goal is to split them into two groups to minimize the difference in their total weights. This can be seen as a variant of the partition problem, which is a well-known problem in computer science. The least possible weight after all combinations and possible weightings must be found, which essentially translates to finding the minimum absolute difference between the sums of two subsets.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We can utilize a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently:
1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.
2. Define a target as half of this total weight. The problem can be reframed to find the largest subset sum that does not exceed this target.
3. Use a DP array to keep track of possible sums that can be formed with the stone weights.
4. Iterate through each stone, updating the possible sums in the DP array.
5. Finally, compute the minimum difference based on the best achievable sum relative to the total weight.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * W), where n is the number of stones, and W is the total weight of the stones, because we need to iterate through each stone and update the DP table for all possible sums up to W.
- **Space Complexity**: O(W), using a 1D array to store the possible sums.
