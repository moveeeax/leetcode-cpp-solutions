# **[Largest Element in an Array after Merge Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-element-in-an-array-after-merge-operations/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to evaluate a series of merge operations on an array. Specifically, we need to determine the maximum value in the array after merging adjacent elements multiple times. The merge operation is defined to result in the sum of two adjacent elements ‚Äî this is repeated until we can no longer merge. Therefore, the key insight is that each element can eventually contribute to the maximum possible output based on the cumulative sum of the individual elements.

Given the nature of merge operations, which essentially involve combining numbers, the maximum after all operations would be equal to the sum of all elements in the array. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Calculate the Sum**: The largest element after all merge operations is simply the sum of all elements in the given array. This is due to the requirement that merging will combine values without any intermediate consideration ‚Äî they will simply add up.
2. **Return the Sum**: We directly return this sum as the result of our function.

This approach is simple and efficient because it requires only a single iteration through the array to calculate the total. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we need to iterate through the entire array to compute its sum.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we're using only a constant amount of extra space for the sum calculation.
