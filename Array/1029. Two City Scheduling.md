# **[Two City Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to send `2n` people to two different cities (A and B) at the minimum cost. Each person has a distinct cost associated with traveling to both cities, which is provided as a list of costs where the ith entry is a pair `[costA[i], costB[i]]`. Our objective is to choose `n` people for city A and `n` for city B, minimizing the overall travel cost.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Costs**: The first step involves determining how much "cheaper" it is to send someone to one city versus the other. For each person, we can compute the difference in costs: `costA[i] - costB[i]`. 
2. **Grouping the Decisions**: By sorting the people based on this difference, we can prioritize those who are significantly cheaper to send to one city over the other.
3. **Choosing the Optimal Group**: After sorting, the first `n` people (after sorting by the cost difference) will be sent to city A and the remaining `n` will be sent to city B.
4. **Calculating Total Cost**: The final step is to sum the costs of sending the selected `n` people to city A and the remaining `n` to city B.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the list of costs.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only need a fixed amount of space beyond the input.

            totalCost += costs[i][0]; // Cost for first n people to city A
        }
        for (int i = n; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
            totalCost += costs[i][1]; // Cost for remaining n people to city B

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `two_city_scheduling.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
