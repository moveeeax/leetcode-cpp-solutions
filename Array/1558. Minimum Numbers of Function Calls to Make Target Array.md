# **[Minimum Numbers of Function Calls to Make Target Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-numbers-of-function-calls-to-make-target-array/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
To address the problem, we need to determine the minimum function calls required to construct a given target array from an initial array of zeros. The function allowed is incrementing any element of the array by a power of 2, which is a crucial aspect of our strategy. The challenge is to minimize the number of function calls while accurately building the target array.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding the Operation**: Each element in the target array can be obtained using powers of 2, i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. Thus, to create the target array, we should analyze how many times we can utilize these powers for each element.
  
2. **Counting Function Calls**: For each element in the target array, we need to break it down into sums of distinct powers of 2, which can be determined using its binary representation. The number of function calls corresponds to the number of '1's in the binary representation of the individual elements.

3. **Finding Maximum Powers**: Since we can perform increments simultaneously on different elements, the total function calls required will be determined by the highest number of times we increment elements at any given time, which depends on the largest element in the target array. Therefore, we must track both the count of distinct powers of 2 needed (minimum number of calls) and the maximum element (for the multipliers).

4. **Combining Results**: The overall result will be the maximum number of function calls needed to get the target values plus the count of distinct powers of 2 needed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the target array. We iterate through the array once to process each value and its binary representation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a few variables to store intermediate results, regardless of the input size.

            // Track the maximum power of 2 needed for this number
            maxPower = max(maxPower, num);
        }

        return operations + (maxPower > 0 ? 1 : 0); // We need at least one call for the max power
    }
