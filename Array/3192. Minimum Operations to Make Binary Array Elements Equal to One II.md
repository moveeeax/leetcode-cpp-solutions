# **[Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to transform a binary array of 0s and 1s such that all elements become 1 with a minimum number of operations. An operation consists of choosing any element of the array and changing it to 1, but there's a caveat that convolves the problem: there's a circular aspect to the indices. If we change an element, we incur a cost that can impact neighboring values, specifically the previous and next indices in a circular fashion. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Gaps**: First, determine segments of 0s (gaps) between 1s. 
2. **Count Operations**: For each gap, compute the minimum number of operations required to cover it. Gaps can be managed by considering:
   - Gaps entirely surrounded by 1s.
   - Gaps that connect the start and end of the array due to the circular nature.
3. **Optimal Calculation**: By using the identified segments, find the best operation count needed to ensure that all elements turn into 1s. 
4. **Edge Cases**: Consider scenarios where the entire array consists of 1s or no series of 1s. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we are traversing the array a constant number of times.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of space regardless of input size.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int operations = 0;
        
        // Count the number of 0s and find continuous segments of 0s.
        vector<int> segments;
        int countZero = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                countZero++;
            } else {
                if (countZero > 0) {
                    segments.push_back(countZero);
                    countZero = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // In case the array ends with a zero, we need to consider that.
        if (countZero > 0) {
            segments.push_back(countZero); 
        }

        // If there are no zeros, no operations are needed.
        if (segments.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }

        operations = segments.size();

        // Conglomerate the first and last segments if needed
        if (nums[0] == 0 && nums[n-1] == 0) {
            operations--;  // Merge first and last segments into one
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
