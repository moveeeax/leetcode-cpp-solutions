# **[Minimum Swaps to Arrange a Binary Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-arrange-a-binary-grid/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to transform a binary grid (a matrix filled with 0s and 1s) into a specific format with minimal swaps of adjacent rows. Each row in the transformed grid should have a certain number of trailing zeroes corresponding to the number of 1s in that row and the total number of rows below it. Given the nature of the task, our goal is to identify how many swaps of rows are required to achieve the desired format.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count the Number of 1s in Each Row**: We need to evaluate how many consecutive 1s are present from the leftmost column towards the right, as they are the influence of the arrangement of rows.
2. **Calculate the Required Zeros**: For every row, calculate the number of trailing zeros it should have based on its position in the grid and the total size of the grid.
3. **Determine Possible Swaps**: Start from the top row and identify the rows which can be swapped with the current row to bring it into compliance with the binary grid format. The rows which contribute towards the number of 1s need to be swapped until we reach a valid state with minimum swaps.
4. **Count the Swaps**: As we find rows that are out of position, count how many swaps are needed to arrange the rows correctly.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows (or columns, since the grid is square). This is because we may need to inspect multiple rows for placing any particular row correctly.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of additional space.
