# **[Find the Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-largest-area-of-square-inside-two-rectangles/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to determine the maximum area of a square that can fit inside the overlapping region of two rectangles defined by their bottom-left and top-right corners. Each rectangle is defined by two coordinates, and we have to calculate the intersection area between these two rectangles to find the largest square that can fit within this area. 

To visualize this, we can think of the two rectangles on a 2D coordinate plane and their bounding coordinates. The largest square that can fit inside the intersection would have its side length determined by the shorter side of the intersection rectangle.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Calculating Coordinates**: First, we need to figure out the boundaries of the intersection area. This involves finding the maximum of the bottom-left x and y coordinates and the minimum of the top-right x and y coordinates for both rectangles.
  
2. **Determining Area**: After we have the intersecting corners, we simply calculate the width and height of this area. The size of the largest square that can fit inside this intersection is determined by the smaller dimension of this rectangle.

3. **Compute Area**: The area of the square is then the side length squared.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), since the calculations involve a fixed number of arithmetic operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few variables to store the coordinates and dimensions.
