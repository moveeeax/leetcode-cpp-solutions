## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In the IPO problem, we are given a company looking to raise capital by issuing `k` initial public offerings (IPOs) over a period of time. Each company has a certain potential profit it can generate if its IPO is executed at a given time. We also have the option to invest in other companies, which could provide additional profit.

The goal is to maximize profits by selecting the best possible IPOs to invest in, while adhering to the constraints regarding available funds and the investment limitation of `k` IPOs. The intuition here is to adopt a greedy strategy, emphasizing the most profitable opportunities based on the available options within the fund constraints.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle this problem, we will use a combination of a min-heap (priority queue) to manage the available companies based on their profits, and a max-heap to select the top `k` profitable IPOs efficiently. The steps to achieve the solution can be summarized as follows:

1. **Sort Companies by Cost**: The first step is to sort the companies based on their IPO costs, which allows us to add companies into our investment perspective as we have available funds.
2. **Use Min-Heap for Profits**: We leverage a min-heap to maintain the profitable IPOs that we can take advantage of as we "invest" in the companies.
3. **Iterate Through Each Company**: We iterate through sorted companies, adding IPOs to our investment potential based on an available fund while also considering the possibility of executing these IPOs to unlock more funds.
4. **Maximize Profits with a Limited Budget**: Keep track of the maximum achievable profit as we execute the IPOs and reinvest any profits to maximize returns.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n + k log k), where n is the number of companies and k is the limit on the number of IPOs. The sort operation takes O(n log n), and every insertion and extraction from the heaps will take logarithmic time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storage of companies and for the priority queues.
