# **[Meeting Rooms III](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around scheduling meetings in a conference room. Given a continuous time range defined by a number of meetings, the task is to determine how many meetings can fit in that range, as well as other factors such as the number of rooms needed if all meetings are to be scheduled. The aim is to use the input meetings to derive the least number of rooms while capturing essential details such as the maximum number of simultaneous meetings and the times they occur.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we can utilize a min-heap structure to manage ongoing meetings and their end times. This allows us to efficiently allocate rooms and determine when meetings overlap. Specifically, the approach includes:

1. **Sorting Meetings**: We start by sorting the meetings based on their start times. This makes it easier to manage which meetings are currently in-progress as we process them.
  
2. **Using a Min-Heap**: With a min-heap, we track the end times of meetings currently taking place. Every time we add a new meeting:
   - If the start time of the new meeting is greater than the earliest ending meeting (top of the heap), we can reuse that room.
   - If not, we need an additional room; hence we add the new meeting's end time to the heap.

3. **Count Rooms and Max Meetings**: Throughout this process, we can update our counters for the maximum number of rooms used and handle simultaneous meetings effectively.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step and log n insertions into the heap.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case when all meetings overlap, and we store them in the heap.

public:
    int minMeetingRooms(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        // Check for edge case where no meetings are present
        if (intervals.empty()) return 0;

        // Create a min-heap to track end times of meetings
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;

        // Sort the meetings in ascending order based on the start time
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });

        // Start by adding the first meeting
        minHeap.push(intervals[0][1]);

        // Process all the remaining meetings
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            // If the meeting starts after the first meeting in the heap ends, reuse the room
            if (intervals[i][0] >= minHeap.top()) {
                minHeap.pop();
            }

            // Add the current meeting's end time to the heap
            minHeap.push(intervals[i][1]);
        }

        // The size of the heap tells us the minimum number of rooms required
        return minHeap.size();
    }
};
```
