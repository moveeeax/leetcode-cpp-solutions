# **[Add Minimum Number of Rungs](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-minimum-number-of-rungs/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around determining the minimum number of rungs (steps) that need to be added to a ladder represented as a series of integers for a person to climb without skipping more than a defined number of steps (`dist`). Given a list of existing rungs and a maximum climbing distance, the goal is to ensure that the heights are appropriately spaced such that the person can climb from one rung to the next without facing difficulty. Essentially, we are calculating the gaps between the existing rungs and assessing how many new rungs are necessary for seamless climbing.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Begin by setting a counter (`num_rungs`) to zero to keep track of the number of added rungs. Also, initialize a variable to represent the height of the last rung climbed (`current_height`), starting at 0 since the climber begins from the ground.
2. **Iterate Through Rungs**: Loop through the list of rungs:
   - For each rung, calculate how far it is from the `current_height`.
   - If the difference between the `current_height` and the current rung exceeds the allowed `dist`, calculate how many new rungs are needed to bridge that gap.
   - For each required rung, increment the `num_rungs`.
   - Update `current_height` to the position of the current rung after adding any required rungs.
3. **Return Result**: Once all existing rungs have been processed, return the total number of rungs added.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rungs, since we have to iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

            if (gap > dist) {
                int additional_rungs = (gap - 1) / dist; // (gap - 1) / dist gives number of rungs needed
                num_rungs += additional_rungs;
            }
            current_height = rung; // Move to the current rung
