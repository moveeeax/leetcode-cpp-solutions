# **[Chalkboard XOR Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/chalkboard-xor-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem presents a scenario where two players take turns performing actions on an array `chalk`. The player can choose any of the indices and has to consume `chalk[i]` amount of chalk. The game ends when a player cannot perform their action because there isn‚Äôt enough chalk left. The XOR of the numbers represents the essence of their move choices. A key observation is that if the cumulative XOR of the elements in the `chalk` array is `0`, it indicates that the starting player is in a losing position when both play optimally.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To determine who will win the game:
1. Compute the XOR of all elements in the `chalk` array. If the result is not zero, it indicates that the first player can secure a win by having an optimal strategy.
2. If the XOR is zero, the second player wins since every move taken by the first player can be mirrored or countered by the second player.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) ‚Äî This is due to the single traversal needed to compute the XOR of all elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) ‚Äî No additional space proportional to the input size is used.

        int xorSum = 0;
        for (int num : chalk) {
            xorSum ^= num;
        }
        return xorSum == 0 || chalk.size() % 2 == 0;
    }
};

int main() {
    ChalkboardXORGame solution;
    vector<int> chalk = {5, 1, 1, 2};
    bool result = solution.xorGame(chalk);
    cout << (result ? "First player will win" : "Second player will win") << endl;
