# **[Substring With Largest Variance](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-largest-variance/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find a substring within a string that maximizes the "variance" of two different characters. The variance is defined as the number of occurrences of the first character minus the number of occurrences of the second character. Our goal is to maximize this difference for any substring in the given string. 

Key points to consider:
- We need to consider all pairs of characters from the string.
- The substring should be valid, meaning if we count the first character in the variance, we need to ensure that there's at least one occurrence of the second character within that substring to make the count meaningful.
- The challenge combines concepts from substring searching and character counting.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Character Pairing**: We will iterate through all unique character pairs in the string. For each pair (a, b), we will determine how many times 'a' appears more frequently than 'b' in any substring.
  
2. **Modified Kadane's Algorithm**: We will apply a modified version of Kadane‚Äôs algorithm:
   - Initialize counts for both characters (countA and countB) and track the maximum variance found.
   - Traverse the string, maintaining the counts:
     - Increment countA when we encounter 'a'.
     - Increment countB when we encounter 'b'.
     - Whenever countB exceeds countA, reset the counts as we need 'a' to be at least as frequent as 'b' for valid variance.
   - Track the maximum variance whenever countA - countB is computed.

3. **Complexity Handling**: Given that the potential number of character pairs from the string is limited (26 lowercase English letters), we can afford a double loop that runs through the characters and the string, making it feasible within time constraints.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(26 * n) = O(n) (since there are 26 lowercase characters and we're iterating through the string for each pair).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space.
