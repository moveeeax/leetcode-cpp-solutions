# **[Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves matching two groups: players and trainers based on their respective experience levels. Players only want to play for trainers whose experience levels are greater than or equal to their own. The goal is to maximize the number of such matches. Given the sorted nature of trainers and the requirements of players, a two-pointer technique can be efficiently used to find the optimal matches. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting**: Both players and trainers need to be sorted by their experience level to facilitate efficient pairing.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: 
   - Have one pointer iterate through the players starting from the weakest to the strongest.
   - Use another pointer to iterate through the trainers.
   - Move the trainer pointer forward until a suitable trainer is found for the current player or until all trainers are exhausted.
3. **Matching Logic**:
   - For each player, if a trainer is found (i.e., the trainer's experience is at least equal to the player's), count this match and move to the next trainer and the next player.
   - If the trainer‚Äôs experience is lower than the player‚Äôs, move to the next trainer.
4. **Count Matches**: Continue this process until we exhaust either the player or the trainer list.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m log m + n log n) due to sorting both lists, where m is the number of players and n is the number of trainers. The two-pointer matching runs in O(m + n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the pointers and counts, as the sorting happens in-place.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `maximum_matching_players_with_trainers.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`.  
3. **Include necessary headers**: `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`, `#include <algorithm>`.  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**.  
5. **Compile and run the program**.
