# **[Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-limited-sum/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given array such that the sum of the subsequence elements is less than or equal to a given limit. A subsequence is defined as a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or none of the elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For this problem, we need to identify which elements to include in our subsequence to maximize its length while ensuring that their sum does not exceed the specified limit.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The most effective way to solve this problem is:
1. **Sorting**: First, sort the array. This allows us to start including smaller numbers first, which helps in maximizing the count of elements in the subsequence without quickly exceeding the sum limit.
2. **Iterative Summation**: Initialize a sum counter to zero and a count variable for the length of the subsequence. Iterate through the sorted array, adding elements to the sum and incrementing the count as long as adding the current element does not exceed the limit. If adding the next element would exceed the limit, we stop counting further as all subsequent elements will only be larger.
3. **Output the count**: The count will represent the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirement.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if the sorting is done in place, as we do not use any additional structures.
