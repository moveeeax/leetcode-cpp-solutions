# **[Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem aims to determine the minimum cost required to cut a stick of length `n` into certain segments. The cost is determined by the positions at which cuts are made, and each cut adds to the total cost based on its position. To solve this problem efficiently, we must consider both the lengths of the segments required and the costs accumulated from each cut.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We can utilize a dynamic programming approach that captures the minimum cost of making cuts on the stick. We define a DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cutting cost for the segment of stick between positions `i` and `j`.

2. **Base Case**: If there are no segments to cut between `i` and `j` (i.e., `j - i < 2`), then no cost is incurred (`dp[i][j] = 0`).

3. **Recursive Case**: For every possible cut `k` that can be made between `i` and `j`, the cost to cut between these positions involves:
   - The cost of cutting at position `cut[k]` (the value of the cut),
   - Plus the cost of cutting the left segment (`dp[i][k]`),
   - Plus the cost for the right segment (`dp[k][j]`).
   We take the minimum of all possible cuts to find the optimal cost.

4. **Result**: The final result will be found in `dp[0][len(cuts) + 1]`, which represents the full stick from 0 to `n` including the boundaries for the cuts (at position 0 and `n`).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m^3) where `m` is the number of cuts, since we are evaluating each sub-segment and trying each cut position in between.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m^2) for the DP table.
