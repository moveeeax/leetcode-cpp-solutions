# **[Brick Wall](https://leetcode.com/problems/brick-wall/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around a brick wall composed of rows of bricks, where each brick has a given width. The goal is to determine how to minimize the number of vertical lines needed to pass through the wall such that these lines do not intersect with any bricks. We want the lines to align with the edges of the bricks, allowing some rows to be aligned perfectly without any brick intersections.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To achieve our goal, we can utilize a two-step approach:

1. **Count The Gaps**: For each row of bricks, compute the cumulative width of the bricks until each gap appears. This gives us the positions where vertical lines can potentially be drawn without hitting a brick.
2. **Determine Most Common Gaps**: Using a hash map, we can record how many times each position (gap) occurs across all rows. The gap with the highest occurrence will tell us the optimal place to draw vertical lines, minimizing the total number of lines needed.

By performing the counting of gaps and determining the most common gap, we can derive the number of vertical lines needed as the total number of rows minus the maximum number of gaps.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the maximum number of bricks in a row. We are iterating over all rows and bricks to compute gaps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), which is used for the hash map to store the gap positions.

            // We go through all bricks except the last one to avoid edge case
            for (int i = 0; i < row.size() - 1; i++) {
                totalWidth += row[i];
                gapCount[totalWidth]++;
                maxGaps = max(maxGaps, gapCount[totalWidth]);
            }
        }
        
        return wall.size() - maxGaps; // Total rows minus the most common gap count
    }
