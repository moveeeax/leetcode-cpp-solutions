# **[Car Fleet II](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we have cars driving towards a destination along a straight road. Each car has a position and a speed, and we need to determine how many fleets (groups of cars that drive together) will eventually reach the destination. A fleet is formed when slower cars catch up and drive together with faster cars.

The challenge arises from the need to calculate how many cars will reach the destination at the same time, taking the individual speeds and positions into account. As the cars will initially be at different positions and may have different speeds, it's important to calculate their meeting points due to varying speeds.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Input Parsing**: We receive two arrays: positions and speeds of the cars. The destination is a fixed value.
2. **Sorting**: We combine the positions and speeds into pairs and sort them based on positions in descending order. This helps us analyze the cars from the furthest ahead to the start.
3. **Fleet Calculation**: We iterate over the sorted list of cars and calculate the time it takes each car to reach the destination. If a car reaches the destination slower than another that is already in its fleet, it will form a fleet with it. Thus, we can count how many unique fleets reach the destination.
4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the count of distinct fleets.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the cars based on positions.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the cars in pairs (positions and speeds).

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `CarFleet.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `CarFleet` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
