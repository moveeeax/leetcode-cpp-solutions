# **[Frog Jump II](https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In the Frog Jump II problem, we are tasked with minimizing the maximum possible height of the stone to which the frog can jump, given a set of stones each at different heights. The frog may jump from stone to stone, but the allowed jumps can vary based on the maximum height it is willing to tolerate. Essentially, we are looking for the least height that the frog will have to deal with during its journey across the stones.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize a binary search method on the potential maximum jump height. The key steps in our approach are as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Identify the minimum and maximum heights of the stones to set our search boundaries.
2. **Binary Search**: We will perform a binary search on the height values. For each mid-value (representing a maximum jump height), we evaluate if the frog can traverse all the stones without exceeding this height.
3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check involves simulating the frog's jumps:
   - Start from the first stone and check each subsequent stone to determine if it can jump to that stone considering the current maximum jump height.
4. **Adjust Search Space**: If the frog can jump to all stones with the current `mid` height, we attempt to find a smaller maximum height by adjusting the search boundaries; otherwise, we increase the height.

This method takes advantage of the ordered nature of heights, allowing us to efficiently zero in on the solution.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * log(m)), where n is the number of stones and m is the difference between the maximum and minimum stone heights. Each height checks all stones.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space.
