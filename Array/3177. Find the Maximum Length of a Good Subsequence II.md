# **[Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-a-good-subsequence-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum length of a "good" subsequence from a given string `s`. A "good" subsequence must not contain two characters that are the same and adjacent. This means that if we are to include a character in our subsequence, we must ensure that its previous instance in the original string is not included. We need to maximize the length of this subsequence while adhering to the "good" condition.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can adopt a greedy approach:
1. **Character Tracking**: Use a set to track which characters have already been included in the good subsequence.
2. **Iterate through the string**: For each character in the string, check if it is already in the set:
   - If it is not, include it in the good subsequence and add the character to our set.
   - If it is already present, we skip that character.
3. **Count the Length**: The size of the set at the end will give us the maximum length of the good subsequence, as it only contains unique characters.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we are iterating through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the string, since we are using a set to store the characters.
