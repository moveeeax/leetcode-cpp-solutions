# **[Minimum Adjacent Swaps for K Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-adjacent-swaps-for-k-consecutive-ones/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
We need to reorganize a binary string (consisting of '0's and '1's) such that we can achieve at least `k` consecutive '1's. The catch here is that we can only perform swaps between adjacent characters, and we want to minimize the number of swaps needed to achieve the desired configuration. The problem can be visualized as a sliding window problem, where we‚Äôll keep track of segments of '1's and their distances for calculating swaps.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Positions of '1's**: First, extract all indices where '1's are located in the string.
2. **Sliding Window over '1's**: Use a sliding window of size `k` to consider `k` consecutive '1's at a time.
3. **Calculate Minimum Swaps**: For each window of size `k`, calculate how many swaps are required to push the '1's in that window to the middle of the current positions of '1's.
   - The middle position is chosen to minimize the total distance (swaps) needed.
   - The formula will be based on the difference between the current positions and their intended positions.
4. **Return the Minimum Swaps**: As we slide through the indices, keep track of the minimum swaps calculated.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the input string, since we are effectively traversing the string to find '1's and a second pass with the sliding window.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) where k is the number of '1's, which is the space used to track their indices.

public:

        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> ones;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                ones.push_back(i);
            }
        }

        // Calculate the initial number of '1's
        int oneCount = ones.size();
        if (oneCount < k) return -1; // Not enough '1's to form k consecutive '1's

            // Calculate the swaps to get k '1's together starting from position ones[i]
            for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
                cost += ones[i + j] - ones[i] - j; // distance from desired positions
            }
