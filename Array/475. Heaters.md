# **[Heaters](https://leetcode.com/problems/heaters/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to find out how much heat is needed to ensure that every house in a list is warmed up by the nearest heater. Each heater has a certain position, and we need to calculate the minimal distance from each house to the nearest heater. 

To solve this problem, we can utilize a binary search approach. Since the heaters are given in a list that can be sorted, we can leverage the sorted nature to efficiently find the closest heater for each house using the `std::lower_bound` function.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Heater List**: We first need to sort the `heaters` array since this allows us to quickly identify the closest heater to any given house.
2. **Binary Search for Closest Heater**: For each house's position, we will use binary search to find the closest heater. This can be done using `std::lower_bound`, which finds the first element that is not less than the house's position.
3. **Calculate Distances**: For each house, compute the distance to the nearest heaters found on either side of the house (if they exist).
4. **Collect Maximum Distances**: Track the maximum distance needed from any house to the nearest heater, which is the result we want.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log m), where n is the number of houses and m is the number of heaters. We perform a binary search for each house.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We use a constant amount of extra space.
