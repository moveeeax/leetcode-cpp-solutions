# **[Difference Between Ones and Zeros in Row and Column](https://leetcode.com/problems/difference-between-ones-and-zeros-in-row-and-column/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are given a binary matrix that consists of 0s and 1s. The task is to adjust the matrix such that the difference between the count of 1s and 0s in each row equals the difference between the count of 1s and 0s in the corresponding column. Essentially, we need to ensure that for each cell, the condition of difference (1s - 0s) is preserved across both dimensions‚Äîrows and columns.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Ones and Zeros**: We need to count the number of ones and zeros in each row and column.
2. **Calculate Differences**: For each row, we will compute the difference, which is the count of ones minus the count of zeros. This will help us understand how many additional 1s or 0s are required.
3. **Assign Adjustments**: We can assign adjustments based on the differences calculated to make the counts equal as per the problem statement.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for storing the difference counts for rows and columns.
