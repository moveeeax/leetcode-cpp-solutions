# **[Count Number of Special Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-special-subsequences/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of "special" subsequences in a binary string composed of characters '0' and '1'. A special subsequence is defined as a valid string that starts with '0' and ends with '1', where there are zero or more characters in between. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle the problem, we can employ a two-pass approach:
1. **Forward Pass**: Count the number of '0's we encounter as we move through the string.
2. **Backward Pass**: For each '1' we find, we will take into account the zeros counted so far, since each '1' can form new special subsequences with all the '0's we have seen before it.

The key points to focus on:
- Maintain a running total of zeros as we iterate through the string.
- For each '1' found, add to the final count the number of '0's seen before it, which gives us the number of special subsequences ending with that '1'.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we make a single pass through the input.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

                zeros++;
            } else if (c == '1') {
                count += zeros;  // count all zeros that can precede this '1'
            }
        }

        long long count = 0, zeros = 0;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '0') {
                zeros++;
            } else if (c == '1') {
                count += zeros;  // count all zeros that can precede this '1'
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    CountSpecialSubsequences solution;
    string input;
    cout << "Enter a binary string: ";
    cin >> input;
    int result = solution.countSpecialSubsequences(input);
    cout << "Count of special subsequences: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
