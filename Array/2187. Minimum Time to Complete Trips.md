# **[Minimum Time to Complete Trips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to find the minimum amount of time required for a given number of trips where each trip can be completed at different speeds. Each vehicle associated with a particular speed can only carry out one trip at a time and we want to minimize the total time taken to complete all trips. The key challenge is determining an efficient way to search for the minimum time required, considering the different speeds for the vehicles.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We'll use a binary search approach combined with a greedy algorithm to determine whether a certain amount of time is sufficient to complete all the required trips. The steps are as follows:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given `time` it takes a vehicle with speed `sp` to complete a single trip, hence a vehicle with speed `sp` can complete `floor(time / sp)` trips in that duration.
2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - Set lower bound (`left`) to 1 (minimum possible time).
   - Set upper bound (`right`) to a large number (specifically, the maximum speed multiplied by total trips).
3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - Calculate the midpoint `mid` between `left` and `right`.
   - For the current midpoint `mid`, calculate how many trips can be completed by all vehicles within this time. If it meets or exceeds required trips, we will try to minimize the time further by adjusting the `right` pointer. Otherwise, we will increase the `left` pointer.
4. **Termination**: The search terminates when `left` equals `right`, giving us the minimum time necessary to complete all trips.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log(t)), where n is the number of vehicles and t is the maximum possible time considered. The log factor comes from the binary search over the time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of space.
