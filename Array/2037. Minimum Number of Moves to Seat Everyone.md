# **[Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of moves needed for people to sit in their designated seats. We are provided with two arrays: one representing the current seating arrangement and the other indicating the ideal seating arrangement. The goal is to figure out how many moves it takes to align them correctly, where a move consists of a person changing their seat to occupy another seat.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To find the minimum number of moves:
1. **Sort Both Arrays**: The strategy revolves around sorting both the current and target seating arrays. This allows for a direct comparison between the ideal positions and the current positions.
2. **Calculate Moves**: By iterating through the sorted arrays, we can sum the absolute differences between corresponding elements. The sum represents the total moves required to align the seating arrangements.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), due to the sorting step, where n is the number of people.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using constant extra space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int seatingArrangements(vector<int>& seats, vector<int>& students) {
        sort(seats.begin(), seats.end());
        sort(students.begin(), students.end());
        int moves = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {
            moves += abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        }
        return moves;
    }
};
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `solution.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

class Solution {
public:
    int seatingArrangements(vector<int>& seats, vector<int>& students) {
        sort(seats.begin(), seats.end());
        sort(students.begin(), students.end());
        int moves = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {
            moves += abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        }
        return moves;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> seats = {3, 1, 5}; // Example input
    vector<int> students = {2, 7, 4}; // Example input
    int result = solution.seatingArrangements(seats, students);
    cout << "Minimum number of moves: " << result << endl; // Expected output: 4
    return 0;
}
