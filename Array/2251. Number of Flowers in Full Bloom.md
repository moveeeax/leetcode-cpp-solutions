# **[Number of Flowers in Full Bloom](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-flowers-in-full-bloom/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining how many flowers are in bloom at specific times based on their blooming and wilting schedules. Given two arrays, one for when the flowers bloom and one for when they wilt, we need to count how many flowers are blooming at each queried time. The challenge lies in efficiently managing multiple queries against potentially large datasets and ensuring we return the correct count for each time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structuring**: We represent the blooming and wilting events as pairs of timestamps where a flower begins to bloom and when it wilts. 
   
2. **Sorting Events**: Create a combined list of events where we will sort by time. Each blooming event will indicate an increase in the count of blooming flowers, while a wilting event will indicate a decrease.
   
3. **Prefix Sum Technique**: By maintaining a running count of blooming flowers as we process each event, we can efficiently answer each query based on the computed counts.

4. **Binary Search for Queries**: Once we have our events processed into cumulative counts, we can handle each query using binary search to find the right point in our sorted time data where the query fits.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n + m log n), where n is the number of flowers (events) and m is the number of queries. Sorting will take O(n log n), and each query is processed in O(log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m), we need space for events and the results of the queries.

            currentCount += event.second; // Update the current count based on the event
        }
        count.push_back(currentCount); // Add the final count

        // Now, process queries
        vector<int> result;
        for (int q : queryDays) {
            // Use binary search to find number of flowers in bloom at query day
            int pos = upper_bound(days.begin(), days.end(), q) - days.begin(); 
            result.push_back(pos > 0 ? count[pos - 1] : 0); // If pos is 0, no bloom
        }
