# **[Maximum Distance Between a Pair of Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-distance-between-a-pair-of-values/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of this problem is to find the maximum distance between pairs of integers in two separate arrays, given the condition that one integer must come from the first array (`arr1`) and the second integer must come from the second array (`arr2`). The maximum distance is defined by the absolute difference in their indices. 

For example, if `arr1[i]` is paired with `arr2[j]`, the distance is calculated as `|i - j|`. To maximize this distance, we want to choose the smallest possible index from `arr1` and the largest possible index from `arr2` while ensuring that `arr1[i]` is less than or equal to `arr2[j]`.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: We'll utilize two pointers to traverse the two arrays, maintaining the conditions where `arr1[i]` must be less than or equal to `arr2[j]`. Starting from the first elements of each array, we increase one pointer until we can no longer maintain the condition. By keeping track of the indices, we can compute the distance.

2. **Maximizing the Distance**: For each valid pair found, calculate the distance and update the maximum distance found so far.

3. **Iterational Comparison**: Since both arrays are sorted, this approach allows us to effectively evaluate pairs and is more efficient than checking every possible combination directly.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the length of `arr1` and m is the length of `arr2`. This is because each pointer traverses its respective array at most once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few variables to track indices and maximum distance.

            while (j < m && arr1[i] <= arr2[j]) {
                j++;
            }
            if (j > 0) {
                maxDist = max(maxDist, j - 1 - i);
            }
