# **[Rank Teams by Votes](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-teams-by-votes/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The objective is to rank teams based on votes given in the form of strings. Each character in these strings represents a team, and the order of characters signifies the ranking by each voter. The challenge is to devise a method that accurately ranks the teams by considering ties and aggregate votes. For example, if Team A gets more first-place votes than Team B, Team A should rank higher. However, if teams receive the same number of votes in a certain position, we need to utilize the teams‚Äô names lexicographically to decide their ranks.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Votes**: For each team, maintain an array where each index corresponds to the rank position, and the value stored is the number of votes it received in that position.
2. **Tie-breaking Logic**: When two teams have the same number of votes, their ranks should be evaluated based on their names (lexicographical order).
3. **Sorting**: Finally, we will sort the teams using their scores (from the voting matrix) and names using a custom comparator.
4. **Output the Sorted Teams**: After sorting, put the results into a string array and return it.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m log m), where n is the number of voters and m is the number of teams. The log m factor is for sorting the teams based on their scores and names.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), using space for the count array that holds votes for each rank of the m teams.

                }
            }
            return a < b; // Keep lexicographical order for ties
