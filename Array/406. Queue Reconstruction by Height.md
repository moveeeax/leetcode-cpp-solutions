# **[Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about reconstructing a queue from given people represented by pairs of (height, k). Each pair indicates that the person with `height` should have exactly `k` people in front of them who are taller. The challenge is to arrange them such that this condition holds true for each individual in the queue. Since multiple people can have the same height, the solution needs to consider the possible arrangements while adhering to the `k` conditions.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Sort the Input**: Start by sorting the list of people. First, sort by height in descending order. If two people have the same height, sort by their `k` value in ascending order. This ensures that when placing people in the queue, taller people are positioned first and the one that needs fewer people in front are placed earlier.
   
2. **Insert into the Queue**: Initialize an empty queue (or vector). For each person in the sorted list, insert them into the queue at the index equal to their `k` value. This means for each person, we will place them at the position of how many taller people they want in front of them, effectively reconstructing the queue.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of people.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the output queue.
