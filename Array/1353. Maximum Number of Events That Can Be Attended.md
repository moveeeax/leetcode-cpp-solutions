# **[Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about maximizing the number of events a person can attend, given that each event has a start and end date. To effectively make the best choice of which events to attend, we must consider overlapping event times. The goal is to select a set of non-overlapping events to maximize the total count.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting Events**: First, we sort the events based on their ending time. This allows us to attend the earliest finishing events first, creating more opportunities for subsequent events.
2. **Greedy Selection**: After sorting, we use a greedy approach to select events. We maintain a variable to track the end time of the last selected event. When considering a new event, if its start time is greater than the end time of the last selected event, we can attend it.
3. **Result Calculation**: Each time we can attend a new event, we increase our count.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting the events, where n is the number of events. The subsequent linear scan of the events is O(n), yielding an overall complexity of O(n log n).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if we disregard the input and consider only the variables used for counting and storing the end time of the last selected event.
