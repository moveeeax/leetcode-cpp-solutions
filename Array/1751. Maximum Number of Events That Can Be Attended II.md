# **[Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires finding the maximum profit of attending events where each event has a start and end time, along with a profit. An attendee can attend only one event at a time. The challenge lies in maximizing the profit by selecting non-overlapping events, and we can attend a limited number of events determined by the weight (which represents the maximum events that can be attended). 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Event Representation**: Each event can be represented as a tuple of `(start, end, profit)`. We'll first sort the events based on their end times to facilitate dynamic programming while considering the order of events.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`)**: We'll maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit attending up to the `i-th` event with up to `j` events attended.
   
3. **Base Initialization**: Initialize the first row of the `dp` table for attending zero events, which would be zero profit.

4. **Recurrence Relation**: For each event, decide to either include it (if it doesn't conflict with previous events) or exclude it. If included, calculate the latest non-conflicting event's index and add its profit.

5. **Final Result**: The answer will be found at `dp[n][k]`, where `n` is the number of events, and `k` is the maximum number of events that can be attended.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of events due to sorting events and filling the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n*k), where k is the maximum number of events that can be attended.
