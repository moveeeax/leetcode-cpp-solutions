# **[Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In the game of "Last Stone Weight," you have an array of stones, each represented by a positive integer. The main operation allowed is to take the two heaviest stones and smash them together. If they are of equal weight, they will both be destroyed. If they are of different weights, the weight of the heavier stone minus the weight of the lighter stone will remain. The goal is to determine the final weight of the last remaining stone (if any).

For example, given a stones array `[2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1]`, we can simulate the operations as follows:
1. Smash stones `7` and `8`, leaving `1` (8-7).
2. Next, smash `4` and `1`, leaving `3` (4-1).
3. Continue this process until no stones are left or only one stone remains.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To implement the solution effectively, we can use a max-heap (priority queue) to always have access to the two heaviest stones quickly. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:
1. Push all stone weights into a max-heap.
2. While there are at least two stones in the heap:
   - Extract the two heaviest stones.
   - If they are not equal, calculate the difference and push it back to the heap.
3. If there is one stone remaining in the heap, return its weight; if none remain, return `0`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - each insertion and extraction from the heap takes O(log n), and we potentially perform this operation up to n times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - we may need additional space to store the heap elements.

            int stone2 = maxHeap.top(); maxHeap.pop();

            if (stone1 != stone2) {
                maxHeap.push(stone1 - stone2);
            }
        }

        return maxHeap.empty() ? 0 : maxHeap.top();
