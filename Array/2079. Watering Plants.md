# **[Watering Plants](https://leetcode.com/problems/watering-plants/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are tasked with figuring out how many rounds of watering it will take to fully water a sequence of plants arranged in a line. Each plant requires a specific amount of water to be adequately watered, and we have a limited water capacity in our watering can. The challenge arises primarily from the fact that after watering some plants, if our water can runs out, we must return to the water source to refill before continuing. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we'll simulate the process of watering the plants. We will iterate through each plant:
1. Keep track of the current water left in the can.
2. If there is enough water to water the current plant, we'll water it and reduce the water in the can accordingly.
3. If there is not enough water, we will simulate the action of going back to refill the can, counting the return trip and the outgoing trip needed to reach the current plant.
4. Continue this process until all plants are watered.

The solution involves:
- A loop through each plant, maintaining a count for the number of trips needed to refill the can.
- Managing the water level in the can to avoid watering any plant without sufficient water.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of plants. We have to potentially visit each plant at least once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we are only using a few variables to keep track of the water level and the number of trips, regardless of the size of the input.

                currentWater -= plants[i];  // Water the plant
                trips++;  // Count the trip to the plant
            } else {
                trips += 2;  // Trip to refill and trip to the plant
                currentWater = capacity - plants[i];  // Refill and water the plant

        for (int i = 0; i < plants.size(); i++) {
            if (currentWater >= plants[i]) {
                currentWater -= plants[i];  // Water the plant
                trips++;  // Count the trip to the plant
            } else {
                trips += 2;  // Trip to refill and trip to the plant
                currentWater = capacity - plants[i];  // Refill and water the plant
            }
        }
        
        return trips;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> plants = {2, 4, 5, 1, 2};  // Example input
    int capacity = 5;  // Example capacity
    
    int result = sol.wateringPlants(plants, capacity);
    cout << "Total trips to water the plants: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
