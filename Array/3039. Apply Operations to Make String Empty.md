# **[Apply Operations to Make String Empty](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-make-string-empty/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make a given string `s` empty. An operation allows us to remove a character from the string at a specified index, and we can do this as many times as needed. If the input string contains consecutive identical characters, we can choose to remove these by operating on these indices.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, the goal is to perform the operations such that we maximally eliminate characters in the fewest operations. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:
1. **Count Identical Characters**: Traverse through the string, counting occurrences of identical consecutive characters.
2. **Application of Operations**: For each character segment, determine how many operations this will take to make the string empty. For example, if a character appears consecutively three times, it implies that we can eliminate it through three separate steps if we were to choose one at a time.
3. **Sum Total Operations**: Finally, count all the operations needed for all character segments.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s` since we only need to traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we're using constant space for the counting mechanism.

            operations++;  // We need one operation to remove this character segment.

            // Skip all identical characters
            while (i < s.size() && s[i] == current_char) {
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
