# **[Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-tastiness-of-candy-basket/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves finding the maximum tastiness value we can achieve when selecting distinct candy types with constraints on their tastiness values and the number of candies. We need to maximize the minimum difference between the tastiness values of the candies selected in the basket. The task essentially requires checking for a valid selection of candies that maximizes this minimum difference, ensuring that we select a defined number of candies.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Tastiness Values**: This allows us to utilize binary search more effectively. Once sorted, identifying possible tastiness that satisfies the conditions will be easier.
  
2. **Binary Search for Maximum Tastiness**: We will apply binary search over the range of possible minimum tastiness values. The starting point will be `0` and the end point will be the difference between the maximum and minimum tastiness values.

3. **Check Feasibility**: For each mid value in our binary search, we will check if it's possible to select `k` candies such that the minimum difference between selected candies' tastiness values is at least `mid`. This can be done by iterating through the sorted tastiness values and attempting to select candies that respect the difference condition.

4. **Adjusting Binary Search**: If we can select `k` candies with a specified minimum tastiness difference, we have a candidate answer, and we will attempt to find a larger difference. If we can't, we need to move to a smaller difference.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log(max_tastiness_diff)), where `n` is the number of candy types, and `max_tastiness_diff` is the maximum difference in tastiness values. The log factor comes from the binary search.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space aside from the input.
