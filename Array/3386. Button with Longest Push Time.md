# **[Button with Longest Push Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/button-with-longest-push-time/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires identifying which button among a given set of buttons has the longest push time. Each button has a specific push time denoted in seconds, and we need to find the index of the button with the maximum push time. If there are multiple buttons with the same maximum push time, we must return the index of the first button with that maximum value.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing two variables: one for keeping track of the maximum push time encountered so far (`maxPushTime`) and another for the index of that maximum push time (`maxIndex`).
2. **Iteration**: Loop through each button's push time:
   - If the current button's push time is greater than `maxPushTime`, we update `maxPushTime` to be the current button‚Äôs push time and `maxIndex` to the current index.
   - If the current button's push time is equal to `maxPushTime`, we do nothing as we want the first occurrence.
3. **Output**: After finishing the loop, return `maxIndex` which holds the index of the button that had the longest push time.

This approach ensures we traverse the list of push times only once, making it efficient.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of buttons since we only make a single pass through the input list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

        int maxPushTime = 0;
        int maxIndex = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < pushTimes.size(); i++) {
            if (pushTimes[i] > maxPushTime) {
                maxPushTime = pushTimes[i];
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }

        return maxIndex;
    }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `ButtonWithLongestPushTime.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `ButtonWithLongestPushTime` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class ButtonWithLongestPushTime {
public:
    int getMaxPushTimeIndex(vector<int>& pushTimes) {
        int maxPushTime = 0;
        int maxIndex = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < pushTimes.size(); i++) {
            if (pushTimes[i] > maxPushTime) {
                maxPushTime = pushTimes[i];
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }

        return maxIndex;
    }
};

int main() {
    ButtonWithLongestPushTime solution;
    vector<int> pushTimes = {1, 3, 2, 3}; // Example input
    int result = solution.getMaxPushTimeIndex(pushTimes);
    cout << "Index of button with longest push time: " << result << endl; // Expected output: 1
    return 0;
}
```
