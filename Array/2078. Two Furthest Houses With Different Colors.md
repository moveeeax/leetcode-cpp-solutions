# **[Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-furthest-houses-with-different-colors/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the maximum distance between two houses located on a street that have different colors. We are given an array where each element represents the color of a house, and we need to identify the indices of two houses that are of different colors and that maximize their distance.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Identify the color of the first house from the start of the array and the last house from the end of the array.
2. Traverse from the left side to find the last occurrence of a house with a different color than the first house.
3. Traverse from the right side to find the last occurrence of a house with a different color than the last house.
4. Calculate the distances based on the indices found in steps 2 and 3 and return the maximum.

This approach allows us to achieve the result in a single pass for each side of the street, leading to an efficient solution.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of houses in the array. We traverse the array at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a few extra variables to store indices and colors.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& colors) {
        int n = colors.size();
        int firstColor = colors[0];
        int lastColor = colors[n - 1];

        // Traverse left to find the farthest house with different color from first house
        int maxDistance = 0;

        // Option 1: Check the last occurrence of a different color from the start
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (colors[i] != firstColor) {
                maxDistance = max(maxDistance, i);
            }
        }

        // Option 2: Check the first occurrence of a different color from the end
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (colors[i] != lastColor) {
                maxDistance = max(maxDistance, n - 1 - i);
            }
        }
        
        return maxDistance;
    }
};  
```

public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& colors) {
        int n = colors.size();
        int firstColor = colors[0];
        int lastColor = colors[n - 1];
        int maxDistance = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (colors[i] != firstColor) {
                maxDistance = max(maxDistance, i);
            }
        }

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (colors[i] != lastColor) {
                maxDistance = max(maxDistance, n - 1 - i);
            }
        }
        
        return maxDistance;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> colors = {1, 1, 2, 1, 1};
    cout << solution.maxDistance(colors) << endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
