# **[Task Scheduler II](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The Task Scheduler II requires us to determine the minimum time needed to finish executing a series of tasks, given that certain tasks cannot be executed consecutively unless a cooldown period has been observed. Each task can be represented by its type, denoted by uppercase letters, and the function must track the last time each task was completed to ensure cooldown conditions are respected. The main challenge is to efficiently manage the execution timeline and enforce the cooldown constraints while minimizing idle time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structures**: We will use a hash map (or unordered map) to keep track of when each type of task was last executed. This allows us to quickly look up whether a task can be executed based on the current time and its previous execution time.
   
2. **Simulation Loop**: We'll iterate over the total number of tasks needed to be executed. For each time unit, we will:
   - Check if there is any task that can be executed at this time. If we find a valid task that meets the cooldown requirements, we execute it and record its new execution time.
   - If no tasks can be executed (i.e., all tasks are currently within their cooldown period), we will increment the time without executing any task, effectively introducing idle time.
   
3. **Final Time Calculation**: The total time taken will be incremented every time a task is executed or when idle time is added.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of tasks due to a single pass through the tasks.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique tasks stored in the hash map.

            // If the task can be executed (not in cooldown), execute it
            if (lastExecution.find(task) == lastExecution.end() || time - lastExecution[task] > cooldown) {
                lastExecution[task] = time; // Update the last execution time for this task
            } else {
                // If the task is still in cooldown, we need to wait
                time = lastExecution[task] + cooldown; // Fast-forward to the end of cooldown
                lastExecution[task] = time; // Execute the task now
            }
            time++; // Increment time for this task execution
        }
        
        return time; // Total time for executing all tasks
    }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `TaskSchedulerII.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `TaskSchedulerII` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class TaskSchedulerII {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int cooldown) {
        unordered_map<char, int> lastExecution;
        int time = 0;
        
        for (char task : tasks) {
            if (lastExecution.find(task) == lastExecution.end() || time - lastExecution[task] > cooldown) {
                lastExecution[task] = time;
            } else {
                time = lastExecution[task] + cooldown;
                lastExecution[task] = time;
            }
            time++;
        }
        
        return time;
    }
};

int main() {
    TaskSchedulerII scheduler;
    vector<char> tasks = {'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B'};
    int cooldown = 2;
    
    int result = scheduler.leastInterval(tasks, cooldown);
    cout << "Total time to finish all tasks: " << result << endl; // Expected output: 8
    
    return 0;
}
```
