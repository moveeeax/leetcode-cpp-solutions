# **[Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal-to-target/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make an array equal to the target array, which has all its elements set to a certain value. Each operation allows us to increase or decrease an array element by 1. We can infer that if all array elements are to be set to a certain value, let‚Äôs consider that value as the average of the current elements which will help in minimizing operations.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Determine Target Value**: The target value can be expressed as a mean of the first and last value in the array since the numbers within are continuous integers. In this case, the target value will be `target = (n + 1) / 2` where `n` is the length of the array. 
2. **Compute Operations**: For each element in the array, compute how many operations (increments or decrements) are needed to transform that element into the target value. The total number of operations required will be the sum of these individual operations.
3. **Return the Result**: The final step is to return the total computed operations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as we only perform basic arithmetic operations regardless of the size of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use a constant amount of extra space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(int n) {
        // Calculate the target value
        int target = (n + 1) / 2; 
        // Since we need to perform operations on each of the n elements:
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            operations += abs(i - target);
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

        int target = (n + 1) / 2; 
        // Sum the operations needed to make each element equal to the target
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            operations += abs(i - target);
