# **[Prison Cells After N Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a row of prison cells that can be occupied (1) or vacant (0). The state of each cell changes based on the occupancy of its adjacent cells every day. Specifically, a cell becomes occupied if both of its neighbors are occupied or both are vacant; otherwise, it becomes vacant. The challenge lies in determining the state of the cells after a specified number of days, N. 

Given that the states of the cells are cyclical and repeat after a certain period, the goal is to compute the final state after N days efficiently.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Cycles**: The state of cells will repeat after a certain number of days due to the limited configurations (as there are only 2^6 possible states for a row of 8 cells). This means rather than simulating all N days, we can reduce N to within the cycle length to get the same result.
2. **Simulate Day Changes**: Start with the initial configuration of cells and update their states for each day by checking adjacent cells. Store configurations to detect when cycles start repeating.
3. **Output Final State**: Once we've simulated up to the effective N (or found a cycle), output the final state of the cells. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(, where c is the cycle length and at most 14, thus making it effectively O(1) in terms of large inputs).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed-size array to maintain the state of cells.
