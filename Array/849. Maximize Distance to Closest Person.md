# **[Maximize Distance to Closest Person](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are tasked with finding the maximum distance from an empty seat to the nearest person seated. We start with a row of seats represented as an array, where `1` denotes a person and `0` denotes an empty seat. The goal is to place a person in an empty seat such that they are as far away as possible from the closest person already present.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Distances**: We will iterate through the `seats` array and identify the distances to the nearest person for each empty seat. 
2. **Calculate Maximum Distance**: As we traverse the seats, we need to maintain two pointers: a front pointer which keeps track of the previous person and a back pointer that helps in evaluating the distance correctly for the empty seats.
3. **Check Edge Cases**: We also need to handle cases at the start and the end of the row where there could be multiple consecutive empty seats.
4. **Determine Maximum**: Finally, we calculate the maximum distance from the seat placements and return that value.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of seats since we only pass through the seats array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of additional space.

        int max_distance = 0; // Maximum distance found

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (seats[i] == 1) {
                if (last == -1) {
                    // Case when all seats to the left are empty
                    max_distance = i; // Distance from left edge to first person
                } else {
                    // Case for seats between two people
                    int distance = (i - last) / 2; // Mid distance between two persons
                    max_distance = max(max_distance, distance);
                }
                last = i; // Update last position to current person
            }
        }

        // Check the distance to the last person from the end of the row
        if (last != n - 1) {
            max_distance = max(max_distance, n - 1 - last);
        }

        return max_distance;
    }
};
