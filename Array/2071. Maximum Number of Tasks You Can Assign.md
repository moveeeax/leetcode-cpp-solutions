# **[Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-tasks-you-can-assign/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to assign tasks to workers based on their assigned maximum workload and the tasks' required units of work. Each worker can only perform one task at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of tasks that workers can complete given their workload limits. The challenge lies in optimally matching tasks and workers based on their workloads in an efficient manner.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we can use a greedy algorithm approach. Here are the key steps we will follow:
1. Sort both the workers' workload capacities and the tasks' required units. This makes it easier to match the least productive workers with the least demanding tasks, and progressively move towards more demanding tasks and productive workers.
2. Utilize two pointers to iterate through the sorted lists of tasks and workers:
   - If a worker can handle a task, assign the task to that worker and move both pointers forward to check for the next available worker and the next task.
   - If a worker cannot handle a task, move the worker pointer forward to check the next available worker who might be able to handle the task.
3. Count the number of successfully assigned tasks as we proceed through the lists.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of tasks and m is the number of workers. This is due to the sorting of both lists.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the two-pointer approach as we only use a fixed number of additional variables.
