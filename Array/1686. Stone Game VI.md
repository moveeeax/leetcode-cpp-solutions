# **[Stone Game VI](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-vi/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In the problem "Stone Game VI", we are dealing with a game where two players alternately pick stones from piles while trying to maximize their respective scores based on the given values of each pile. The player who picks first can choose from all available piles, while the second player always follows the first player's choice.

The twist here is that piles have different values associated with them, leading to the need to evaluate the combined score difference when making a selection. The goal is to determine who will win the game based on the values defined for the two players.

The input consists of two integer arrays `A` and `B`, where:
- `A[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` pile for player one,
- `B[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` pile for player two.

We need to process these arrays to see which player will have the advantage in terms of total score after the game concludes.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To find the winner, we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the score of each player from all available piles based on the strategy they would use.
2. Sort the piles based on the combined score defined as `A[i] + B[i]` in decreasing order. This ensures that players will prioritize the highest combined scores available when making their selections.
3. Simulate the selection process:
   - The first player picks the highest available combined score pile.
   - The second player also picks the next highest available combined score pile.
4. Alternate the picks until all piles are processed, keeping track of the scores accumulated by both players.
5. Compare the final scores to determine the winner:
   - If player one's score is higher, return `1`.
   - If player two's score is higher, return `-1`.
   - If both players have equal scores, return `0`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the piles based on combined values.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the combined scores and indices during sorting.
