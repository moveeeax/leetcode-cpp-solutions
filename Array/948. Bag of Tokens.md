# **[Bag of Tokens](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a player who has a bag of tokens, each with a certain value. The player can choose to either gain or lose points by utilizing the tokens under specific conditions. Gaining points from tokens requires using their value, while losing points lets the player discard less valuable tokens to earn more. The goal is to maximize the number of points the player can gain by strategically using the tokens based on their values. This leads us to consider a sorting approach where we can efficiently determine the maximum points based on the tokens the player can collect and use.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Tokens**: Start by sorting the array of tokens. This will allow us to use the smallest tokens first to gain points and use the largest tokens to lose points efficiently.
2. **Two-pointer Technique**: Use two pointers ‚Äì one starting at the beginning (for gaining points) and one at the end (for losing points). 
   - If we have enough points, we can gain points by using the token at the start (increment the gain pointer).
   - If we don't have enough points, we can discard the token from the end to increase our points (decrement the lose pointer) if any tokens are left.
3. **Counting Maximum Points**: Maintain a counter for the number of points collected, updating it based on the operations performed until we can no longer gain or discard tokens.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting the tokens. The two-pointer traversal will take O(n), leading to a total of O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are sorting in place and using variables for pointers and counters, not requiring additional space proportional to the input.
