# **[Min Cost to Connect All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to connect all points on a 2D plane with the minimum possible cost. The cost to connect two points is given by the Manhattan distance between them. The challenge is to find the total minimum cost to connect all points, which means we need to ensure we connect all points in a way that minimizes this total cost.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: Treat each point as a node in a graph. The edges between them are the costs represented by Manhattan distances.
2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: The problem can be solved by finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of this graph. We can use algorithms like Prim's or Kruskal's to find the MST.
3. **Prim's Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Maintain a priority queue to always expand the least costly edge.
   - Use a boolean array to track which points have been included in the MST.
   - Initialize the cost to 0 and add the edges from an arbitrary starting point to the priority queue.
   - Continuously pop the smallest edge from the queue and if it connects to a new point, add its cost to the total and push its edges to the queue.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices (points). In this case, V = n and E can be up to O(n^2), leading to an overall complexity of O(n^2 log n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), primarily for the priority queue and the visited array.
