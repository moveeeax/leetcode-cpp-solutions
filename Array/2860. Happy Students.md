# **[Happy Students](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-students/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around determining how many students, represented as integers, can be classified as "happy." A student is considered happy if there are no other students with the same rating in the array. We need to loop through the student ratings and count the number of unique ratings while also ensuring that we only count them if their frequency is exactly one. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Frequency**: Utilize a frequency map (or hash map) to keep track of how many times each student rating appears.
2. **Count Happy Students**: Iterate through the frequency map to count how many ratings have a frequency of exactly one, which indicates the student with that rating is happy.
3. **Return the Count**: Finally, return the count of happy students.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of students (size of the input array). We go through the array twice: once to fill the frequency map and once to count happy students.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case where all ratings are unique, meaning we store each rating in the map.

```cpp

        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        // Count the frequency of each rating
        for (int rating : ratings) {
            freq[rating]++;
        }

        int happyCount = 0;
        // Count how many students have a unique rating
        for (auto& entry : freq) {
            if (entry.second == 1) {
                happyCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return happyCount;
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `happy_students.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `HappyStudents` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

            freq[rating]++;
        }

        int happyCount = 0;
        // Count how many students have a unique rating
        for (auto& entry : freq) {

int main() {
    HappyStudents solution;
    vector<int> ratings = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4}; // Example input
    int result = solution.countHappyStudents(ratings);
    cout << result << endl; // Output expected: 1 (only rating '4' is unique)
    return 0;
}
