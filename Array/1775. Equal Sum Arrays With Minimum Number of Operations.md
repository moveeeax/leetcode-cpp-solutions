# **[Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-sum-arrays-with-minimum-number-of-operations/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to transform two integer arrays, `A` and `B`, into arrays with equal sums by performing the minimum number of operations. An operation consists of incrementing or decrementing an element of one of the arrays by 1. The key insight is that we should not only consider the absolute difference of sums but also plan our modifications in the most efficient way.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we perform the following steps:
1. **Calculate the target sum**: Determine what the equal target sum between the two arrays would be by averaging their initial sums.
  
2. **Determine the difference**: Find the difference in sums between the two arrays and note whether A has a larger or smaller sum than B.

3. **Count operations**: Use a greedy approach to evaluate how many increments or decrements would be necessary to equalize the sums. This can involve either adjusting smaller elements of the larger-sum array to be closer to the target sum or adding to the elements of the smaller-sum array.

4. **Return the number of operations**: The result should be the total number of necessary operations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two arrays `A` and `B`, respectively. We go through each list to sum their respective values.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space for variables to store sums and the differences, without any dependency on input size.

public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        long sumA = accumulate(A.begin(), A.end(), 0);
        long sumB = accumulate(B.begin(), B.end(), 0);

        // If sums are already equal
        if (sumA == sumB) return 0;

        // Ensure A is the smaller sum
        if (sumA > sumB) {
            swap(A, B);
            swap(sumA, sumB);
        }

        vector<int> ops(100001, 0);
        for (int a : A) ops[a]++;
        for (int b : B) ops[100000 - b]++;

        long diff = sumB - sumA; // The amount we need to bridge
        int operations = 0;

        // Start from the largest element down to minimize operations
        for (int i = 100000; i >= 0 && diff > 0; --i) {
            if (ops[i] > 0) { // There are elements to decrease
                long maxReduction = ops[i] * i; // Max reduce we can do
                long reduce = min(diff, maxReduction);
                operations += (reduce + i - 1) / i; // Calculate how many operations
                diff -= reduce; // Reduce the remaining difference
            }
        }
        
        return diff > 0 ? -1 : operations; // If diff is not zero, impossible
