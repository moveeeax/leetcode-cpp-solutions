# **[Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around determining the "town judge" from a given list of trust relationships among residents in a town. Each person in the town is identified by a unique integer. The town judge is a person who:
- Is trusted by everyone else (i.e., every other person trusts them).
- Does not trust anyone else.

To solve this, we can utilize two arrays or hash maps to keep track of trust counts (for both trusted and trusters). 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Use an array or two hash maps to keep track of how many people trust each person and how many people each person trusts.
2. **Iterate through trust relationships**: For each trust relationship, update the trust count of the person who is being trusted and the trust count of the person who trusts.
3. **Identify the judge**: After processing all trust relationships, find the person who is trusted by `n-1` others (where `n` is the total number of people) and who trusts no one (trust count is 0).
4. **Return the judge's ID**: If such a person does not exist, return -1 to indicate that there is no town judge.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of trust relationships, as we simply traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since we are storing trust counts in an array or map.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        vector<int> trustCounts(n + 1, 0);
        
        // Process each trust relationship
        for (const auto& relation : trust) {
            int a = relation[0]; // person who trusts
            int b = relation[1]; // person who is trusted
            
            trustCounts[a]--; // a trusts someone, so decrease their trust count
            trustCounts[b]++;  // b is trusted by a, so increase their trust count
        }
        
        // Find the town judge
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (trustCounts[i] == n - 1) {
                return i; // this person is trusted by n-1 people and trusts no one
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // no town judge found
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `find_the_town_judge.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
