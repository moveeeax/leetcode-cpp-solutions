# **[Maximum Number of Jumps to Reach the Last Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-jumps-to-reach-the-last-index/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about finding the maximum number of jumps needed to reach the last index of an array, where each element represents the maximum jump length from that position. The objective is to maximize the number of jumps while ensuring that we can reach the end of the array. If we think of each jump as a step forward, we realize that our current position's jump length defines how far we can potentially leap in the next step.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To determine the maximum number of jumps, we can use a greedy approach. We will maintain the furthest point we can reach as we iterate through the array. At each position, we will also count how many jumps we need to make to reach the end of the array. The essential steps are as follows:
1. Start from the first index and initialize the number of jumps to `0`.
2. Keep track of `current_end`, which indicates the furthest point we can reach with the current number of jumps.
3. As we iterate through the array, if we reach the `current_end`, we increment the jump counter and set a new `current_end` based on the furthest point that can be reached from the positions we've traversed.
4. If at any point `current_end` exceeds or reaches the last index, return the number of jumps made.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of space.
