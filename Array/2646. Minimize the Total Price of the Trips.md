# **[Minimize the Total Price of the Trips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-total-price-of-the-trips/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem presents a scenario where we have a list of trips represented by their starting and ending points, along with a specified cost for each visit. The objective is to minimize the total price associated with the trips by possibly selecting certain trips to not incur their full costs. Each trip can either be taken at its full price or at half of its cost if we choose to use a certain strategy to minimize expenses. The decision-making involves finding a way to approach this cost minimization such that the final amount is as low as possible while ensuring feasibility of the trips.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize dynamic programming. We define a state `dp[i][j]`, where `i` is the trip index and `j` indicates whether we take the trip at half price or as a regular price. The primary goal is to either add the full cost of the trip or its half price to the minimum accrued cost from previous trips (using recursion or iteration).

1. **Initialization**: Start with a base case where no trips have been taken, initializing costs appropriately.
2. **Recursion/DP Table**: Update the DP table by iterating through trips. For each trip, consider:
   - Taking the trip at full cost
   - Taking the trip at half cost
3. **Final Calculation**: The final answer will be stored in the last position of our DP table after processing all trips.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - where n is the number of trips, as we traverse each trip and evaluate two possible costs.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - for storing the DP table to maintain the two states of full and half pricing options.

                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - 1] + tripCost / 2);      // Take half price
