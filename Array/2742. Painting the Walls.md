# **[Painting the Walls](https://leetcode.com/problems/painting-the-walls/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining the maximum number of walls that can be painted using a list of colors while adhering to the specific condition of adjacent walls not being of the same color. The goal is to maximize the number of walls painted given a specified number of walls (n) and a list of available colors (k). The challenge here is to find a systematic approach to count the maximum unique color arrangements without violating the adjacent color rule.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We can analyze the output by checking that for each wall, we can utilize the available colors under the condition that the same color cannot be adjacent.
2. The primary breakdown of the problem stems from the relationship between the total number of walls, n, and the total available colors, k.
3. Given the conditions:
   - If k = 1 (one color available), we can only paint one wall.
   - If k = 2 (two colors available), we can paint all walls because we can alternate colors.
   - If k >= n (more colors than walls), we can paint all walls as well.
4. Based on this, we derive that the maximum number of painted walls can be calculated using the formula: 
```  
max_painted_walls = min(n, k) + (k > 1 ? 0 : 1)
``` 
5. This effectively assesses the limits imposed by both the number of walls and the available colors.
