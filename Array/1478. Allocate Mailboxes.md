# **[Allocate Mailboxes](https://leetcode.com/problems/allocate-mailboxes/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about allocating mailboxes in a way that minimizes the total distance that residents must travel to reach their mailbox. Each resident is positioned at certain points, and the goal is to select a subset of these points to place mailboxes. The main challenge lies in optimally choosing these mailbox locations such that the total distance from each resident to the nearest mailbox is minimized.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize dynamic programming combined with a pre-computed distance table. Here are the key steps of the approach:

1. **Distance Calculation**: Compute the distance from each resident to every possible mailbox.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: 
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the minimum total distance when using the first `i` residents and placing `j` mailboxes.
   - Initialize `dp[0][0]` to `0` since no distance is incurred when there are no residents and no mailboxes.
   - Initialize `dp[i][0]` to infinity for all `i > 0` because if no mailboxes are placed, distance can't be defined.
   - Initialize `dp[0][j]` for all `j > 0` also to infinity since zero residents can't have a defined distance.

3. **Optimal Substructure Construction**:
   - For each resident `i`, compute `dp[i][j]` by going through all previous residents to determine where to place the last mailbox.
   - For each segment of residents from `prev` to `i`, calculate the cost of placing a mailbox for all of them together.

4. **Result Compilation**: The final answer would be stored in `dp[n][k]`, where `n` is the total number of residents and `k` is the number of mailboxes.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^3), where `n` is the number of residents due to the nested loops for setting up `dp` based on segments.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n*k), for storing the `dp` array.
