# **[Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem focuses on determining how many operations can be performed while achieving the same score after each operation. Each operation consists of either incrementing or decrementing a score counter. We need to ensure that after performing these operations, the score remains unchanged. Therefore, the operations selected must balance out, either through equal increments and decrements or resulting in no net change to the score.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding the Inputs**: The function takes in integer `n` which represents the target score and a list of integers `operations` which represents the scores achieved by performing operations.
  
2. **Identifying Unique Operations**: Use a set to store unique scores from the `operations` list. This ensures that we only consider distinct values.

3. **Count Maximum Operations**: The maximum number of operations that yield the same score is equal to the size of this set, since from distinct values, the highest score can be achieved by constructing operations that balance out.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of elements in the `operations` array, due to the need to process each distinct score.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) for storing unique operations in a set.
