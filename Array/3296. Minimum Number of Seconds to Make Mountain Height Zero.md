# **[Minimum Number of Seconds to Make Mountain Height Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-seconds-to-make-mountain-height-zero/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds needed to make all the mountain heights zero from a given list of heights. Each mountain height can be reduced by one unit every second. However, to optimize the process, we can also take advantage of the fact that mountains can "collide" if their heights are reduced simultaneously. 

In more straightforward terms, if we have an array of heights, we want to find the maximum height and assess how many seconds it would take to reduce all heights to zero. The trick is that as we reduce heights from the highest point, some valleys formed between mountains can also be reduced in the same time frame. We should focus on how we can optimally reduce these heights.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify unique heights**: First, we need to find the unique mountain heights available.
2. **Calculate the maximum height**: The number of seconds required to make all heights zero will fundamentally depend on the maximum height in the list.
3. **Use a set**: We can use a set to efficiently track unique heights and also to sort them.
4. **Count reductions**: We can count the reductions in such a way that when we start from the maximum height downwards, we can calculate how many rounds it will take to reduce all mountains to zero.

This gives us a systematic way to assess the required seconds while also considering simultaneous reductions. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting of unique heights.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing unique heights.
