# **[Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-that-can-be-formed-by-characters/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine which words from a given list can be formed using a collection of letters. Each letter in the collection can only be used as many times as it appears; however, the string of characters does not have to be rearranged. Instead, we need to check if each word can be constructed from the characters we have based on their frequencies.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count the Available Characters**: We will use a frequency map (or array) to count how many times each character appears in the available string of letters.
2. **Check Each Word**: For each word in the list, we'll verify if we can construct it using the characters from our frequency map:
   - For each character in the word, check if it exists in the frequency map and if it can be formed with the available counts.
   - If any character's count in the word exceeds the count in the frequency map, that word cannot be formed.
3. **Result Collection**: We will collect the words that meet the criteria and return them as our result.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the longest word since we are processing each character of each word against the frequency map.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed size array for letter counts (26 for lowercase English letters).

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `find_words.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
