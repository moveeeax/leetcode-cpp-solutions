# **[Put Marbles in Bags](https://leetcode.com/problems/put-marbles-in-bags/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are given two Arrays: `weights` and `bagCount`. The task is to distribute the marbles (represented by the weights) among a specific number of bags (given by bagCount). We need to find out the maximum and minimum weights that could be contained in a single bag after distributing the marbles. The distribution must follow the constraint of placing one marble in one bag per operation. The goal is to handle the distribution such that we can output both maximum and minimum possible weights.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. **Sort the Weights**: First, we sort the `weights` array. This helps in easily picking the largest and smallest weights for the bags.
2. **Calculate Maximum Weight**: For the maximum weight, we take the sum of the largest `bagCount - 1` weights from the sorted list.
3. **Calculate Minimum Weight**: For the minimum weight, we take the sum of the smallest `bagCount - 1` weights from the sorted list.
4. **Return Results**: Finally, we return the results of the maximum and minimum weights calculated.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting the weights array, where n is the number of weights.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of space to store additional variables.

        for (int i = 0; i < bagCount - 1; ++i) {
            minWeight += weights[i];
            maxWeight += weights[weights.size() - 1 - i];
        }
        
        return {minWeight, maxWeight};
    }
};
