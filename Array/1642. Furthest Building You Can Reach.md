# **[Furthest Building You Can Reach](https://leetcode.com/problems/furthest-building-you-can-reach/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem consists of a sequence of buildings, each with a height that can be crossed using either a ladder or wood. The goal is to reach the furthest possible building, starting from the first one, using a limited number of tools to overcome the height differences. We are provided with the heights of each building, the maximum height difference that can be crossed using a ladder, and a total amount of wood available for cases where the height difference exceeds the ladder capability.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initial Setup**: We need to track how far we can go using a combination of ladders and wood. The input parameters are heights of buildings, the ability to use ladders, and the wood available.
  
2. **Use a Min-Heap**: To decide which building‚Äôs height differences should be crossed with ladders, we can use a min-heap. This helps us keep track of where we need to use ladders effectively in an efficient manner.

3. **Iterate Through Buildings**: Starting from the first building, iterate through the buildings to calculate the height difference:
   - If the next building is taller, calculate the difference.
   - If this difference is less than or equal to `k`, we can use a ladder without needing wood, so we push it to the min-heap.
   - If it's greater than `k`, we check if we have enough wood to make up for the height difference after using the ladders we've counted so far.

4. **Decision Making**: After encountering a building that cannot be crossed using available resources (ladders + wood), we break the loop and return the index of the last accessible building.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of buildings; we may push to the heap for each building.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), in the worst case if all building heights are added to the heap.
