# **[Distribute Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-candies/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we have a collection of candies, and we want to distribute them evenly among a given number of children. The goal is to determine how many candies each child will receive when the candies are distributed evenly, and how many candies are left over. We can think of the candies as items that are shareable, and we need to compute both the quotient and the remainder of the candies distributed among the children.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we will apply simple integer division and modulus operations. The approach works as follows:
1. **Calculate the candies per child**: Use integer division to find out how many candies each child will receive. This can be computed as `candies / num_people`.
2. **Calculate remaining candies**: Use the modulus operator to find out how many candies will remain after the distribution. This is computed as `candies % num_people`.

Given that both operations are constant time operations (O(1)), we can expect our solution to be very efficient.

        int i = 0;
        while (candies > 0) {
            distribution[i % num_people] += min(candies, i + 1);
            candies -= (i + 1);
            i++;
        }
        return distribution;
