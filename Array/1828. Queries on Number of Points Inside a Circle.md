# **[Queries on Number of Points Inside a Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-on-number-of-points-inside-a-circle/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the number of points from a set of points that fall within or on the circumference of a specified circle for multiple queries. Each query is defined by the circle's center `(x, y)` and its radius `r`. The aim is to provide efficient answers since both the number of points and the number of queries can be large.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Input Parsing:** First, we'll parse the input to get all the points and the queries.
2. **Distance Calculation:** For each query, we will check each point's distance from the center of the circle to determine if it lies inside or on the boundary of the circle. The distance check is done using the formula for distance squared to avoid floating-point computations, which can lead to precision errors. Specifically, we will compare `distance_squared <= r^2`.
3. **Efficient Counting:** To improve performance, we can sort the points based on their coordinates. However, since we need to check distance from a dynamic center for each query, we will implement a brute force check which is manageable within acceptable limits given constraints are often lenient.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m) where `n` is the number of points and `m` is the number of queries.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (excluding input storage).
