# **[Closest Room](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-room/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires determining the maximal size of a room that can be chosen from a list of rooms, with respect to certain constraints. The input consists of two arrays; the first describes various rooms with dimensions and their identifiers, while the second comprises a list of queries that specify constraints regarding which rooms can be chosen and the minimal area allowed for the room selected. 

The goal is to process each query and return the room ID that matches the criteria of being within a specified size limitation while being as large as possible. If no matching room is found, we return -1.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Storing Rooms**: First, we need to store room information in a way that allows us to quickly assess their dimensions based on the query constraints. This can be achieved by indexing rooms using their IDs and storing their dimensions in a suitable structure.
  
2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, we evaluate the current rooms that can potentially be chosen:
   - Filter rooms based on the area constraint from the query.
   - Among those filtered, choose the room with the maximum area. If there are ties, select the room with the larger ID.
  
3. **Dynamic Handling**: Since rooms that can be used may change across queries (based on previous selections), we need to keep track of which rooms are still available.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of queries and n is the number of rooms. This arises because for each query, we might filter through each room to find a match based on the criteria.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), to store room dimensions and identifiers.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `ClosestRoom.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `ClosestRoom` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
