# **[Reduce Array Size to The Half](https://leetcode.com/problems/reduce-array-size-to-the-half/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about reducing the size of an array `arr` such that the size of the reduced array is at most half of the original size. We need to determine the minimum number of distinct elements we need to remove to achieve this goal. The key insight is that removing the most frequently occurring elements will maximize the reduction in size, leading to a minimal count of distinct elements removed.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To efficiently solve this problem, we can take the following steps:
1. Use a frequency map to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
2. Store the frequencies in a priority queue (or a max-heap) to easily access and remove the most frequent elements.
3. Continuously remove elements from the heap and keep a count of how many elements we have removed until the total number of remaining elements in the array is less than or equal to half of the original size.

The algorithm consists of:
- Creating a frequency counter for the elements.
- Inserting the frequencies into a max-heap.
- Popping elements from the heap until the condition is met, while counting how many distinct elements we removed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we need to count the frequencies (O(n)) and then manage the frequencies in a heap (O(log n) for each insertion and deletion).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the frequency map.
