# **[Maximum XOR After Operations ](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-after-operations/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves manipulating an array of integers to maximize the XOR result by applying a specific operation to some elements of the array. The operation allows us to add any integer `x` to the `i-th` element of the array, effectively letting us control each element's value. The challenge is to determine the maximum XOR that can be achieved after performing such operations.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **XOR Properties**: We need to leverage the properties of XOR. Specifically, `a XOR a = 0` and `a XOR 0 = a`. Additionally, the XOR operation is commutative and associative.
  
2. **Understanding Changes**: By adding an integer `x` to `nums[i]`, we create a new potential value from which we need to calculate the XOR. Essentially, each number in the array can be independently modified, which introduces many combinations for the resulting XOR.

3. **Bitwise Manipulation**: To effectively maximize the XOR, we should analyze how bits contribute to the overall result. Using binary representation can help identify which numbers can yield the highest XOR value given their bits.
  
4. **Brute-force is Inefficient**: With a large number of potential values for `x`, a brute-force solution checking every possibility isn't feasible. Thus, we can utilize a more structured method that considers every bit position one at a time.

5. **Iterative Strategy**: We can iterate through each bit position (from the highest to the lowest) and build the maximum possible XOR incrementally. Starting from 0, we'll check which value can increase our maximum XOR by seeing which combinations provide the necessary bits set.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(32 * n), where 32 is the number of bits in an integer (for 32-bit integers) and `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is efficient because we're iterating through each bit for every element.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.
