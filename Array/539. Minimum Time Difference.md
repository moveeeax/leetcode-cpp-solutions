# **[Minimum Time Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal is to calculate the minimum difference between any two time points given in a list of time strings. Each time string is in the format "HH:MM", representing hours and minutes. The problem requires handling the circular nature of time, so we can wrap around from midnight back to the earliest time. The challenge involves accurately comparing times to find the closest pair across the 24-hour cycle.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Parse Time Strings**: Convert each time string into an integer representing the total number of minutes since midnight. This makes it easier to perform calculations and comparisons.
  
2. **Sort the Times**: Once we have all the times in total minutes, we can sort them to facilitate easier calculation of differences between consecutive times.

3. **Calculate Differences**:
   - Compute the difference between each consecutive pair of times in the sorted list.
   - Additionally, calculate the difference between the last element (largest time) and the first element (smallest time) plus a full cycle of 24 hours (1440 minutes) to account for the wrap-around at midnight.

4. **Return the Minimum**: The result will be the smallest difference computed from the above steps.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - for storing the converted times in minutes.
