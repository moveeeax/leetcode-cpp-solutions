# **[Minimum Replacements to Sort the Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-replacements-to-sort-the-array/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves transforming an array into a non-decreasing order while minimizing the number of operations. Each operation allows you to replace an element with a positive integer that is less than or equal to it. The goal is to determine the minimum number of such operations required to achieve a sorted array. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We can solve the problem by working backward through the array. Starting from the last element, we can ensure that it is not greater than its predecessor. For every element, if it is larger than the next element, we will count how many operations (replacements) we need to reduce it to the maximum value allowed by the next element, ensuring that it does not exceed it and remains non-decreasing. 

1. **Initialize Operations Counter**: Start with a counter for the minimum operations set to 0.
2. **Iterate Backwards**: Traverse the array from the second-to-last element to the first.
3. **Replacement Calculation**:
   - For each element, if it is greater than the element to its right, calculate how many times we would need to replace this element to make it less than or equal to the next.
   - The number of operations required for an element `nums[i]` when `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]` can be calculated as `ceil(nums[i] / nums[i + 1]) - 1`, where `ceil` stands for the ceiling function which denotes rounding up since we want to make all necessary replacements that lead to a valid state.
4. **Cumulatively Count Operations**: Update the operations counter with the number of replacements needed.
5. **Directly Set Next Element**: Adjust the current element to be equal to the maximum allowed to prepare it for the next iteration.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we are making a single pass through the array.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using only a fixed amount of extra space for variables.
