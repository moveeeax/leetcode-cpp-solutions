# **[Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-a-good-subsequence-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the maximum length of a "good subsequence," which is defined based on the frequency of the characters in the string. A good subsequence must contain pairs of characters that do not appear together, hence the relationship has to be formed carefully based on the provided frequencies of characters (0s and 1s). 

To summarize:
- We will iterate through the string.
- Count the occurrences of '0's and '1's.
- To create a good subsequence, we can either:
  - Include all '0's and none of the '1's or vice versa.
- The result will be the maximum count between '0's and '1's.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Characters**: Use simple iteration through the string to count the total number of '0's and '1's.
2. **Calculate Result**: The maximum length of a good subsequence will be the maximum of the two counts obtained.
3. **Return Result**: Output the maximum value corresponding to the gathered counts.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - where n is the length of the input string, as we scan the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - as we only use a constant amount of space for the counters.
