# **[Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around distributing cookies among children so that the maximum number of children can be satisfied with the cookies available. We have two lists: one representing the children's greed factors and the other representing the sizes of cookies. The goal is to find the maximum number of children who can be satisfied with the given cookies. A child is satisfied if they receive a cookie that is equal to or larger than their greed factor.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting**: We will start by sorting both the greed factors and the cookie sizes in non-decreasing order.
2. **Two-pointer Technique**: We will use two pointers to iterate through the sorted lists:
   - One pointer (`child`) will track the current child being considered.
   - The other pointer (`cookie`) will track the current cookie being considered.
3. **Comparison**: If the size of the current cookie can satisfy the current child's greed factor, we will increase both pointers (satisfy this child and move to the next child). Otherwise, we will just move to the next cookie to see if the next cookie can satisfy the current child.
4. **Counting Satisfied Children**: We will maintain a count of how many children have been satisfied during this process.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of children and m is the number of cookies, due to the sorting step.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

            if (s[cookie] >= g[child]) {
                child++; // Satisfy this child
            }
            cookie++; // Move on to the next cookie
        }
        
        return child; // Return the count of satisfied children
    }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `assign_cookies.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

        sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        
        int child = 0, cookie = 0;
        while (child < g.size() && cookie < s.size()) {
            if (s[cookie] >= g[child]) {
                child++;
            }
            cookie++;
        }
        
        return child;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> g = {1, 2, 3};
    vector<int> s = {1, 1};
    cout << "Number of content children: " << sol.findContentChildren(g, s) << endl;

    g = {1, 2};
    s = {1, 2, 3};
    cout << "Number of content children: " << sol.findContentChildren(g, s) << endl;

    return 0;
