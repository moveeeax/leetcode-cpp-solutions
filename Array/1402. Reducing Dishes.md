# **[Reducing Dishes](https://leetcode.com/problems/reducing-dishes/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to maximize the total satisfaction of a set of dishes, represented by an array of integers. Each integer indicates the satisfaction level of the dish. By recalculating satisfaction values based on the order they are served, we can try to increase the overall satisfaction score. The key observation is that serving dishes with higher satisfaction first will always contribute more positively to the overall score, due to the way the algorithm processes the satisfaction levels.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting:** First, we will sort the dishes based on their satisfaction levels in ascending order. This allows us to try serving the best dishes first.
2. **Iterate and Calculate:** After sorting, we'll maintain a running total satisfaction score. For each dish served, we will update our total satisfaction by considering how many dishes have been served and their satisfaction values.
3. **Maximize Satisfaction:** We will keep track of the maximum satisfaction seen thus far and update it accordingly.
4. **Return the Result:** Finally, we will return the maximum satisfaction value.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting the dishes, where n is the number of dishes. After sorting, the further computations are linear, O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since no additional space proportional to the input size is used.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfaction(vector<int>& satisfaction) {
        sort(satisfaction.begin(), satisfaction.end()); // Sort the satisfaction levels 
        int maxSatisfaction = 0, currentSatisfaction = 0, total = 0;

        for (int i = satisfaction.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            total += satisfaction[i]; // Accumulating satisfaction levels
            currentSatisfaction += total; // Incrementally increasing total satisfaction
            maxSatisfaction = max(maxSatisfaction, currentSatisfaction); // Keep track of maximum satisfaction
        }

        return maxSatisfaction; // Return the maximum satisfaction
    }
};
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `ReducingDishes.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfaction(vector<int>& satisfaction) {
        sort(satisfaction.begin(), satisfaction.end());
        int maxSatisfaction = 0, currentSatisfaction = 0, total = 0;

        for (int i = satisfaction.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            total += satisfaction[i];
            currentSatisfaction += total;
            maxSatisfaction = max(maxSatisfaction, currentSatisfaction);
        }

        return maxSatisfaction;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> satisfaction = {-1, -8, 0, 5, -9}; // Sample input
    int result = solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction); // Function call
    cout << result << endl; // Expected output: 14
    return 0;
}
