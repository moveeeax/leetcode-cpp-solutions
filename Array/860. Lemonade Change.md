# **[Lemonade Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem concerns selling lemonade to customers who pay with $5, $10, and $20 bills. The objective is to check whether the seller can provide correct change to each customer when they make a purchase. The seller starts with no money, and we need to ensure they can give the correct amount of change based on the bills received from previous customers. 

To approach this, we must keep track of how many $5 and $10 bills the seller has at any time since the only valid transactions that require change involve these bills. The fundamental rule to remember is that:
- If a customer pays with a $5 bill, no change is needed.
- With a $10 bill, the seller must give back a $5 bill.
- With a $20 bill, they either have to give back one $10 and one $5 bill, or three $5 bills.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Initialize two counters: `five` and `ten` to keep track of the number of $5 bills and $10 bills, respectively.
2. Iterate through each customer in the `bills` array.
3. Depending on the bill paid by the customer:
   - If the bill is $5:
     - Increment the `five` counter (no change required).
   - If the bill is $10:
     - Check if there is at least one $5 bill to give as change:
       - If yes, decrement the `five` counter and increment the `ten` counter.
       - If no, return false (change cannot be given).
   - If the bill is $20:
     - Prefer to give change using one $10 and one $5 bill if available:
       - If yes, decrement both counters.
       - If no, check if there are at least three $5 bills:
         - If yes, decrement the `five` counter by three.
         - If no, return false (change cannot be given).
4. After processing all customers, if all changes have been successfully provided, return true.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of customers (or bills). We iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space for the `five` and `ten` counters.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `lemonade_change.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `LemonadeChange` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
