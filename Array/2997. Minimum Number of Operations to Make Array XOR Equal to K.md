# **[Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array XOR Equal to K](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-xor-equal-to-k/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the XOR of an array equal to a given integer \( K \). Each operation consists of selecting an index in the array and updating the value at that index to any integer. The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. Given the properties of XOR, one key observation is that if we know the current XOR of the array, we can manipulate it to reach our target \( K \) by performing certain operations.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. First, compute the current XOR of the entire array. Let's denote this value as \( \text{current\_xor} \).
2. Now we need to check if \( \text{current\_xor} \) is equal to \( K \):
   - If they are equal, we don't need to perform any operation, so the answer is \( 0 \).
3. If they are not equal, the only way to achieve \( K \) is to perform at least one operation.
4. The minimal number of operations needed would be \( 1 \) in this case, because we can adjust any single element to achieve the desired XOR value.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is due to the need to compute the XOR across all elements of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
