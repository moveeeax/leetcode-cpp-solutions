# **[Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum capacity of a ship needed to ship all packages within a given number of days (`D`). The constraints imply that we have to find a balance between the available days and the weight of the packages. As we want to minimize the ship capacity, we can approach this problem using a binary search combined with a greedy method.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Parameters**: We have an array `weights` containing the weights of packages and an integer `D` representing the number of days available for shipping.
  
2. **Binary Search Setup**: 
   - The possible range for the ship's capacity will be between the maximum weight of a single package (lower bound) and the total weight of all packages (upper bound). This is because the ship must at least be able to carry the heaviest package.
   - We'll perform a binary search to find the minimum capacity that allows us to ship all packages within `D` days.

3. **Greedy Check Function**: 
   - For any capacity `mid` calculated during the binary search, we determine if it is feasible to ship all packages in `D` days using a helper function.
   - This helper function keeps track of the current weight being loaded onto the ship. If adding another package exceeds `mid`, we increment the day count and reset the current weight to the weight of the current package.

4. **Termination of Search**: 
   - If we can ship all packages within `D` days with the current capacity, we attempt to find a smaller capacity by adjusting the binary search range.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log(sum(weights))), where n is the number of packages. This accounts for `log` iterations of binary search and `O(n)` time to check each capacity in the helper function.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using constant space aside from the input weights.
