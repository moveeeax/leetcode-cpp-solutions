# **[Wiggle Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the length of the longest wiggle subsequence from a given array of integers. A wiggle subsequence is defined as a sequence of numbers where the sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing. In simple terms, the sequence should follow the pattern of either going up and then down, or down and then up, repeatedly. 

For example, for an array `nums = [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]`, we can have the longest wiggle subsequence being `[1, 7, 4, 9]`, with the length equal to 4. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach, maintaining two variables to track the lengths of the longest wiggle subsequences that end with an upward or downward wiggle. 

1. **Initialization**: Create two variables, `up` and `down`, both initialized to 1. `up` represents the length of the longest wiggle subsequence that ends with an upward movement, while `down` represents the length that ends with a downward movement.
  
2. **Iterate through the array**: Loop through the array from the second element to the end. For each element:
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, it indicates an upward movement, thus incrementing `up` and maintaining `down`.
   - If the current element is less than the previous one, it indicates a downward movement, thus incrementing `down` and maintaining `up`.
   - If the current element is equal to the previous one, no action is taken as it does not contribute to a wiggle.

3. **Result**: The length of the longest wiggle subsequence is the maximum of `up` and `down`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Since we are using only a constant amount of space for the variables.

            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                up = down + 1; // an upward wiggle
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                down = up + 1; // a downward wiggle
            }
        }
