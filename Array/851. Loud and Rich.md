# **[Loud and Rich](https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about finding out the loudness towards others among a group of people based on their respective loudness levels and their influence. Each person can influence another if they are designated to be louder (i.e., their loudness level is higher). This relation can be represented as a directed graph where each person can be viewed as a node. The goal is to determine, for each person, the individuals who are "louder" than them, taking into account the direct influence they might have or receive.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: Use a directed graph to represent who influences whom. If person A is louder than person B, draw a directed edge from A to B.
2. **Topological Sorting**: Perform a topological sort on the graph to process nodes such that for each directed edge from node A to node B, A is processed before B. This ensures that when we are calculating the louder influences for a person, we have already processed all persons that can influence this person.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to traverse the sorted nodes and calculate how many people are louder than each person by combining the reachable individuals from their louder influences.
4. **Result Compilation**: Finally, compile the results for each person based on the calculations of loudness from their reachable nodes.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + E), where N is the number of people and E is the number of edges (influences) in the graph.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(N + E) for storing the graph and the results.
