# **[Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-student-that-will-replace-the-chalk/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about determining which student will first run out of chalk after repeatedly using it to answer their queries. Each student `i` requires `chalk[i]` amount of chalk to answer a series of queries, and we are given a total amount of chalk `chalkSum`. Our goal is to find the index of the student who cannot finish their required chalk during their turn.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. First, compute the total amount of chalk required for all students, `chalkSum`, which is the sum of all chalk amounts needed by students.
2. If the total `chalkSum` is less than or equal to `totalChalk`, the last student must run out of chalk.
3. If not, we can calculate how many rounds (full cycles) of students can answer their queries with the available `totalChalk`. We will check how many rounds we can accommodate and then determine the maximum chalk used until we find a student who cannot fulfill their chalk request.
4. We continuously subtract each student's chalk requirement from `totalChalk` until we reach a point where a student's requirement exceeds the remaining `totalChalk`.
5. The index of this student is our answer.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of students. This is because we need to iterate through the chalk requirements at most twice: once to calculate total chalk and once to find the index of the failing student.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use constant space for variables.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int chalkReplacer(vector<int>& chalk, int totalChalk) {
        long long totalSum = 0;
        for (int c : chalk) {
            totalSum += c;
        }

        totalChalk %= totalSum;

        for (int i = 0; i < chalk.size(); i++) {
            if (totalChalk < chalk[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            totalChalk -= chalk[i];
        }

        return 0; // this case should not generally hit if inputs are valid
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `FindTheStudentThatWillReplaceTheChalk.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

        for (int c : chalk) {
            totalSum += c;
        }

        totalChalk %= totalSum;

        for (int i = 0; i < chalk.size(); i++) {
            if (totalChalk < chalk[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            totalChalk -= chalk[i];
        }

        return 0; // this case should not generally hit if inputs are valid
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> chalk = {5, 1, 5};
    int totalChalk = 22;
    cout << "The student that will replace the chalk is: " << sol.chalkReplacer(chalk, totalChalk) << endl;
    return 0;
}
