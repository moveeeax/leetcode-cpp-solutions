# **[Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays II](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-incremovable-subarrays-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the number of contiguous subarrays in a given integer array that cannot be made strictly increasing by modifying at most one element in that subarray. A subarray is said to be "incremovable" if there is no single element that can be altered to make the entire subarray strictly increasing. 

To solve this problem, we need to analyze each possible contiguous subarray and check if they are incremovable. A direct approach of checking all subarrays would be expensive in terms of time complexity, especially for large arrays. Therefore, we need an optimized method that leverages the properties of increasing sequences and limits unnecessary checks.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initial Validity Check**: We first check if the input array is strictly increasing overall. If it is, all subarrays are trivially removable, and we return zero.
  
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: We can use a two-pointer approach to reduce the time complexity:
   - Iterate through the array while maintaining the boundaries of the currently considered subarray.
   - For each new element, check if adding this element violates the increasing order.
   - If a violation is found, increment counters based on the possible removals.

3. **Track Violations**: Whenever we find out that the current subarray (defined by our two pointers) does not maintain the increasing order, we need to analyze the situation:
   - Count how many adjustments can be made that still keep the subarray nearly increasing.
   - Keep expanding the right pointer until no more violations can be included in the current subarray.
  
4. **Counting Incremovable Subarrays**: Finally, we sum the total number of subarrays that we classified as incremovable based on the findings.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by each pointer).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We only use a constant amount of extra space to store pointers and counters.
