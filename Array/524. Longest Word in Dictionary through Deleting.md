# **[Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary-through-deleting/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires identifying the longest word in a given dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters from a string `s`. The order of characters in the dictionary word must match the order of characters in `s`, but they don‚Äôt need to be contiguous. If multiple words are the longest, the smallest one in lexicographical order should be returned. 

To solve this, we must check each word in the dictionary to see if it can be formed from the string `s` by maintaining its sequence. A two-pointer technique can be particularly effective for efficiently checking if a word is a subsequence of `s`.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Dictionary**: First, sort the dictionary in descending order by length and then lexicographically in ascending order. This ensures that we first check for the longest words and, among those, the smallest lexicographically.
  
2. **Subsequence Check**: For each word in the sorted dictionary, utilize a two-pointer approach to determine if it can be formed from `s`:
    - One pointer traverses the string `s`.
    - Another pointer traverses the current word in the dictionary.
    - Increment the pointer for `s` every time you match a character with the current word.
    - If you match all characters of the dictionary word, it means the word can be formed.

3. **Output the Result**: The first word that can be formed is the answer since we've processed words from longest to shortest, and within the same length, in lexicographic order.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the length of `s` and n is the total number of characters across all words in the dictionary. This is due to checking each word against `s` using the two-pointer method.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space for pointers and index variables.

```cpp
class LongestWordInDictionaryThroughDeleting {
public:
    string findLongestWord(string s, vector<string>& dictionary) {
        // Sort dictionary first by length (descending) then lexicographically (ascending)
        sort(dictionary.begin(), dictionary.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b) {
            return a.size() > b.size() || (a.size() == b.size() && a < b);
        });

        for (const string& word : dictionary) {
            if (isSubsequence(word, s)) {
                return word;  // Return the first (longest and smallest) valid word found
            }
        }
        
        return ""; // If no word found
    }
