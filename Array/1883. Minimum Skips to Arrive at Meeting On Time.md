# **[Minimum Skips to Arrive at Meeting On Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-skips-to-arrive-at-meeting-on-time/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around calculating the minimum number of times we need to skip a ride, staying on time for a meeting. Given the travel times of multiple segments of a trip and the ability to skip segments, our goal is to determine how many skips are necessary to ensure we arrive at the destination by a specified deadline. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Input Data**:
   - We are given an integer `time` which represents the total time we have to reach the meeting.
   - There is a vector `dist` representing the distance for each segment, and a vector `speed` representing the respective speeds for those segments.
  
2. **Calculate Total Travel Time**:
   - For each segment, compute the time taken without skipping.
   - Use priority data structures to keep track of which segments can be skipped and the resulting impact.

3. **Dynamic Programming / Greedy Approach**:
   - Use a max-heap to prioritize skipping rides that save the most time. 
   - Iteratively check each segment, add to the total time, and when the total time exceeds the available time, evaluate if a skip can be made to adjust it.

4. **Conditions**:
   - If the final total time is within bounds with the calculated skips, return the number of skips.
   - If at any point the segments exceed the given time without possibility of adjustments, return -1.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of segments. This accounts for sorting and heap operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing potential skips in the heap.
