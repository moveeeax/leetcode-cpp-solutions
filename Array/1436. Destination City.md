# **[Destination City](https://leetcode.com/problems/destination-city/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to determine the destination city given a list of paths. Each path in the form of a triplet connects a source city to a destination city. We want to find a city that is never a source, meaning that no path starts from this city; it can only be reached as a destination from some other city.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We will use a set to keep track of all source cities.
2. As we iterate through the given paths (pairs of cities), we will add each source city to this set.
3. After processing all paths, we need to check each destination city in the paths. If a destination city is not found in our set of source cities, then that city is the answer since it is not the starting point for any path and can only be a terminal point.
4. We will return the first such destination city we find.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of paths. We make one pass through the list of paths to build the set of source cities and another pass to identify the destination city.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of unique source cities stored in the set.

        }
        
        for (const auto& path : paths) {
            if (sources.find(path[1]) == sources.end()) {
                return path[1]; // Return the destination city that is not a source
            }
        }
        
        return ""; // This line will never be reached based on problem constraints
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `destination_city.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `DestinationCity` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

            sources.insert(path[0]); // Add source cities to the set
        }
        
        for (const auto& path : paths) {
            if (sources.find(path[1]) == sources.end()) {
                return path[1]; // Return the destination city that is not a source
            }
        }
        
        return ""; // This line will never be reached based on problem constraints
    }

int main() {
    DestinationCity solution;
    
    vector<vector<string>> paths = {{"London", "New York"}, {"New York", "Lima"}, {"Lima", "Sao Paulo"}};
    string destination = solution.destCity(paths);
    
    cout << "Destination city: " << destination << endl; // Expected Output: "Sao Paulo"
    
    return 0;
