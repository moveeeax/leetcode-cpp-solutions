# **[Minimum Amount of Damage Dealt to Bob](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-amount-of-damage-dealt-to-bob/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem entails calculating the minimum damage dealt to Bob given a sequence of attacks represented by a list of integers. Each element in the list indicates how much damage a respective attack can deal. The attacks might also indicate healing if the damage is negative. We need to find a way to execute the attacks such that the total damage is minimized.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The strategy to solve this problem leverages the concept of rolling sums to track the cumulative damage Bob receives as we process the list of attacks. Here are the steps involved in the approach:

1. **Iterate through the actions array** to accumulate damage. 
2. **Keep a counter or a running sum** to maintain the total damage inflicted on Bob so far.
3. **Use a variable to track healing (negative damage)** and ensure that if at any time the total damage becomes negative (meaning Bob is healed), it is adjusted accordingly.
4. **Maximize healing versus damage** by comparing the current total damage with the maximum healing that can be achieved from previous attacks. This ensures that we account for any potential healing through earlier attacks when calculating the end result.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of attacks in the actions array since we only make a single pass through the actions.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a fixed number of helper variables to track the damage and healing.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDamage(vector<int>& actions) {
        int total_damage = 0;
        int max_healing = 0; 
        
        for (int damage : actions) {
            total_damage += damage;
            if (total_damage < 0) {
                max_healing = max(max_healing, -total_damage);
                total_damage = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return max_healing;
