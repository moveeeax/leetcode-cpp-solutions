# **[Average Waiting Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-waiting-time/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to calculate the average waiting time for customers in a restaurant where they place their orders and receive their food with specific timings. Each customer has a timestamp indicating when they arrive, and the duration is given for how long their order takes to complete. The waiting time for each customer is defined as the total time from when they arrive until their order is complete. Our goal is to return the average waiting time rounded to two decimal places.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of customer ordering and receiving their food:

1. **Tracking Time**: We'll maintain a variable, `currentTime`, to keep track of when the restaurant will be ready to serve the next customer.
  
2. **Calculating Wait Time**: For each customer, if they arrive before `currentTime`, they will have to wait the difference. If they arrive after `currentTime`, they will start their order immediately.
  
3. **Total Wait Time**: We will accumulate the total wait time while iterating through all customers, and then compute the average at the end.

4. **Output Formatting**: Finally, the average waiting time will be formatted to two decimal places as specified.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of customers, since we need to iterate through each customer once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed number of additional variables regardless of input size.

        for (const auto& customer : customers) {
            int arrival = customer[0];
            int duration = customer[1];

            if (currentTime < arrival) {
                currentTime = arrival;  // Skip to arrival time
            }
            currentTime += duration;  // Start order
            totalWaitTime += (currentTime - arrival);  // Add to total wait time
        }

        return totalWaitTime / customers.size();  // Calculating average
    }
};  
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `average_waiting_time.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

        double totalWaitTime = 0.0;
        int currentTime = 0;

        for (const auto& customer : customers) {
            int arrival = customer[0];
            int duration = customer[1];

            if (currentTime < arrival) {
                currentTime = arrival;  // Skip to arrival time
            }
            currentTime += duration;  // Start order
            totalWaitTime += (currentTime - arrival);  // Add to total wait time
        }

        return totalWaitTime / customers.size();  // Calculating average
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;

    vector<vector<int>> customers = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 1}};
    double averageTime = solution.averageWaitingTime(customers);

    cout << fixed << setprecision(2) << averageTime << endl; // Output: formatted to 2 decimal places
    return 0;
}
