# **[Sum of Good Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-good-subsequences/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task requires us to compute the sum of all "good" subsequences of a given string consisting of digits from '0' to '9'. A good subsequence is defined as one that contains at least one '1' digit. Given that we will be working with different subsequences, we need to consider the contribution of each subsequence formed by the digits.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Character Parsing**: Traverse the string to count how many '1's and non-'1' characters are present. 
2. **Ways to Form Subsequences**: Each non-'1' character can either be included or excluded. If there are `n` non-'1' characters, we have \(2^n\) possible combinations of these characters.
3. **Good Subsequences**: For each '1' character, there would be multiple subsequences formed with combinations of non-'1' characters.
4. **Contribution Calculation**: For each '1' that appears in the string, we accumulate the total contribution from all possible subsequences formed around it.
5. **Final Summation**: The final result will be the aggregate of all these contributions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we iterate through the string a couple of times.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only need a few variables to maintain counts.

        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        long long count1 = 0, countNon1 = 0;
        
        // Count occurrences of '1' and non-'1' characters
        for (char c : nums) {
            if (c == '1') {
                count1++;
            } else {
                countNon1++;
            }
        }

        // If there are no '1's, return 0
        if (count1 == 0) return 0;

        long long totalContribution = 0;
        long long pow2non1 = 1; // 2^0 for counting non-'1's
        
        // Since we could replace the non-'1' with multiple options 
        totalContribution = (count1 * pow(2, countNon1, MOD)) % MOD;
