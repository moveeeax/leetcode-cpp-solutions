# **[The Employee That Worked on the Longest Task](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-employee-that-worked-on-the-longest-task/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal is to determine which employee worked the longest time on a task among multiple employees. Each employee has a unique ID and a list of task durations corresponding to their ID. We need to identify the employee who has the highest total work duration. If there is a tie in duration, we choose the employee with the smallest numerical ID.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We start by iterating through each employee's record from the input list to calculate their total working hours by summing up the durations of tasks for each employee.
2. We maintain a mapping of employee IDs to their accumulated work hours.
3. After accumulating the hours for all employees, we will traverse the record again to determine which employee has the highest total time worked. If multiple employees have the same duration, we select the one with the lowest employee ID as the final answer.
4. Finally, we return the ID of the employee who worked the longest.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the employee list and sum durations, where n is the number of records.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m) - In the worst-case scenario, we might store every unique employee in a hash map, where m is the unique number of employees.
