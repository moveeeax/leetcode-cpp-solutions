# **[3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find three distinct integers in an array that have the closest sum to a target integer. The challenge is to efficiently explore potential combinations of the integers while keeping track of the minimum difference from the target sum. To do this in an optimized manner, we can leverage sorting and the two-pointer technique to reduce the complexity associated with finding combinations.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Array**: By sorting the input array first, we can utilize the two-pointer approach effectively to find the sums of three numbers.
2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Use a `for` loop to fix one number and then look for two numbers that can be combined with it to get closest to the target.
3. **Use Two Pointers**: For the remaining two numbers, initialize pointers: one at the start (just after the fixed number) and one at the end of the array. Adjust these pointers based on the comparison of their summed value with the target to hone in on the closest sum.
4. **Update Closest Value**: During this process, we keep track of the closest sum found and its difference to the target. If a closer sum is found, we update our closest sum.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is due to the sorting step (O(n log n)) and the nested loop for the two-pointer approach (O(n^2)).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
