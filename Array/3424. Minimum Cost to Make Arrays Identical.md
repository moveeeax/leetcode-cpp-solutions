# **[Minimum Cost to Make Arrays Identical](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-arrays-identical/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost associated with making two arrays identical. Each element in the first array can be changed to any other integer, and each such modification incurs a specific cost that is given. The goal is to minimize the total cost of modifications required to make one array match another.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we follow these steps:

1. **Count Frequencies**: We will count the frequency of each number in both arrays so that we can know how many elements we need to change.
2. **Calculate Excess**: For each unique number in the combined arrays, we will determine how many elements need to be changed in order to match the frequencies of both arrays.
3. **Cost Calculation**: As we calculate the number of changes required for each unique number, we will also sum the costs associated with changing the elements from the first array to match the frequency in the second array.
4. **Return the Minimum Cost**: Finally, we will return the total sum as this will represent the minimum cost to make the two arrays identical.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M) where N and M are the lengths of the two arrays. We are iterating through both arrays to count elements and later calculate costs.
- **Space Complexity**: O(U) where U is the number of unique elements in the arrays since we may need to store the counts for each unique element.
