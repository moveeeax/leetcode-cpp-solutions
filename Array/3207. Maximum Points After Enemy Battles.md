# **[Maximum Points After Enemy Battles](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-after-enemy-battles/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to maximize the points we can achieve after battling a series of enemies. Each enemy battle has a specific number of points we could gain and a level of difficulty that could cause us to temporarily lose points if we choose to skip a battle. The goal is to optimize our strategy in deciding whether to engage in a battle or skip it based on our current score.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize a greedy-like strategy where we simulate each battle in order and keep track of the maximum points we can achieve at each step. The approach can be outlined as follows:

1. We start with 0 points.
2. For each enemy battle, we have two choices:
   - **Attack the enemy**: This will add the points of the enemy to our current total.
   - **Skip the enemy**: This will subtract the difficulty of the enemy from our total points if we have enough points to do so.
3. If skipping reduces our score below zero, we cannot skip any more enemies.
4. We continue this until we have processed all enemy battles and return the maximum score achieved.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the score based on two potential actions for each battle.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of enemies since we process each enemy battle once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a fixed amount of additional space for scoring.
