# **[Online Election](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-election/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The Online Election problem is about keeping track of votes for candidates in an election as they are cast dynamically over time. The goal is to determine which candidate is leading after each vote and to retrieve the leader at any given time. The leader is the candidate with the maximum votes, and in case of a tie, the candidate with the smallest numerical ID is considered to be the leader. 

To implement this, we require a way to count votes for each candidate as votes are provided in a stream, and we must also be able to quickly retrieve the current leader. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a map to keep track of the votes for each candidate.
   - Maintain a variable to track the current leader and their vote count.

2. **Vote Function**:
   - When a vote is cast, increment the respective candidate's vote count in the map.
   - After updating the votes, compare this candidate's votes with the current leader's votes to determine if the leader needs to be updated.

3. **Get Leader Function**:
   - This function will return the ID of the candidate with the maximum votes using the stored information.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where multiple candidates could have the maximum votes by checking the ID to find the smallest.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for each vote and getLeader call, assuming O(1) average case for map operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) where k is the number of candidates since we are storing vote counts for each candidate.

    int currentLeader; // Store the id of the current leader
    int currentLeaderVotes; // Store the number of votes for the current leader

        currentLeader = -1; // Initialize no leader
        currentLeaderVotes = 0; // Initialize zero votes for leader
        for(int i = 0; i < persons.size(); i++) {
            // Update votes for candidates
            this->votes[persons[i]]++;

                if (persons[i] != currentLeader || this->votes[persons[i]] > currentLeaderVotes) {
                    currentLeader = persons[i]; // Update leader
                    currentLeaderVotes = this->votes[persons[i]]; // Update leader vote count
                }
            }
            this->persons.push_back(currentLeader); // Record the leader at this point
        }
    }
    
    int q(int t) {
        return persons[t]; // Return the leader at time t
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `TopVotedCandidate.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `TopVotedCandidate` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
