# **[Sort the Students by Their Kth Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-students-by-their-kth-score/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to sort a list of students based on their scores in a specific subject (kth score). Each student has multiple scores, and we want to sort the students according to their scores in the kth subject, with ties resolved by further sorting based on their scores in the other subjects. If they tie in the kth score too, we can keep their initial order by maintaining stability.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Input Extraction**: First, we extract the students' scores and the index `k`.
2. **Custom Sorting**: We need to sort the scores based on the kth index score. We can accomplish this by using a custom comparator that sorts primarily by the kth score, and in case of a tie, it will consider the other scores as a tie-breaker.
3. **Sorting Algorithm**: Using the STL sort with a comparator function enables us to handle multi-level sorting effectively.
4. **Output Format**: After sorting, we will return the sorted list of students.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of students. This is the time complexity for sorting the list of students.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the students during the sort process.

public:
    vector<vector<int>> sortTheStudents(vector<vector<int>>& scores, int k) {
        sort(scores.begin(), scores.end(), [&k](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            if (a[k] != b[k]) {
                return a[k] > b[k]; // Sort by the k-th score in descending order
            }
            return a > b; // Sort by other scores if k-th scores are the same
        });
        return scores;
    }
};  
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `sort_students.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> sortTheStudents(vector<vector<int>>& scores, int k) {
        sort(scores.begin(), scores.end(), [&k](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            if (a[k] != b[k]) {
                return a[k] > b[k]; // Sort by the k-th score in descending order
            }
            return a > b; // Sort by other scores if k-th scores are the same
        });
        return scores;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<int>> scores = {{10, 6, 9}, {7, 5, 11}, {6, 3, 9}};
    int k = 1; // We sort by the second score (index 1)

    vector<vector<int>> sortedScores = solution.sortTheStudents(scores, k);

    for (const auto& student : sortedScores) {
        for (int score : student) {
            cout << score << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
