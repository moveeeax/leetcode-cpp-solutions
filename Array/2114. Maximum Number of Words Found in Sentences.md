# **[Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-found-in-sentences/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of words in a set of sentences. Each sentence in the input is separated by a space and words are determined by the number of space-separated segments in each sentence. The challenge is to iterate through each sentence, count the words, and identify the maximum count.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: We begin by initializing a variable to track the maximum number of words found (`maxWords`).
2. **Iterate Through Sentences**: For each sentence in the provided vector:
   - Split the sentence into individual words using the space as a delimiter.
   - Count the number of words, which can be done by counting spaces and adding one (as the word count is typically one more than the number of spaces).
   - Update the `maxWords` variable if the current word count exceeds the previously recorded maximum.
3. **Return Result**: Finally, return the `maxWords` which contains the highest number of words found in any sentence from the provided list.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of sentences and m is the average number of words per sentence. This accounts for iterating through each sentence and potentially counting each word.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of space for variables regardless of the input size.

        int maxWords = 0;
        for (const string& sentence : sentences) {
            int wordCount = 1; // Start with 1 to count the first word
            for (char c : sentence) {
                if (c == ' ') {
                    wordCount++;
                }
            }
            maxWords = max(maxWords, wordCount);
        }
        return maxWords;
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `maximum_number_of_words.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
