# **[Smallest Sufficient Team](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-sufficient-team/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem presents a scenario where we need to form a team of individuals, each possessing certain skills. Our goal is to create the smallest possible team that collectively has all the required skills for a given project. Each individual can possess different sets of skills, and we are provided with a list that specifies which skills each person has. 

This is a classic problem of combinations, where we need to explore the subsets of individuals to determine the smallest subset that meets the required skills. A decision tree or bit manipulation may be particularly efficient for this situation, as it allows representing skills concisely and evaluating team combinations comprehensively.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structures**: Use a bitmask to represent skills. Each skill corresponds to a bit position in a binary integer. If a team member has a skill, its corresponding bit in the integer is set to 1. This compactly represents which skills are available in a team.
  
2. **State Representation**: Maintain an array to record the best team size (minimum number of people) required to achieve each skill set. This array will store the smallest number of team members needed to achieve the respective skill combinations.

3. **Generate Combinations**:
   - Iterate through each individual and their skill representation.
   - Update our team size array by checking for each possible skill set already computed. After considering an individual, compute the new set of skills available and update the team size if using that individual offers a better solution (fewer members).

4. **Backtrack to Find Team Members**: After finding the smallest team size needed for all skills, backtrack to identify which individuals form this minimal team.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * 2^m), where n is the number of people and m is the number of unique skills. Each person can potentially contribute to all combinations of skill sets.
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^m), to store the minimum size for each of the possible skill sets.
