# **[Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom](https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-possible-day-of-full-bloom/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal is to determine the earliest day on which all flowers can reach full bloom. Each flower has a planting time and a blooming duration. We need to find the day on which the last flower blooms after attending to the planting and blooming periods of all flowers. This requires carefully considering the sequence of planting and how blooming timings overlap based on the planting days.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Input Parsing**: We will be provided with two arrays, `plantTime` and `bloomTime`, representing the times required to plant each flower and the blooming time after planting, respectively. 
2. **Pairing and Sorting**: Each flower's properties (plant time and bloom time) can be treated as pairs. By sorting them based on their blooming times in descending order, we can ensure that we prioritize the flowers that take the longest to bloom first, leading to an optimal overall blooming schedule.
3. **Simulating Planting**: We will simulate the planting process:
   - Maintain a running total of the days spent planting. 
   - For each flower, we will add its plant time to the running total.
   - The blooming day for each flower will be calculated as the total days spent planting plus its bloom time.
4. **Finding Maximum Bloom Day**: Keep track of the maximum bloom day encountered across all flowers, which gives the earliest possible day by which all flowers will be fully bloomed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of flowers. The subsequent iteration to simulate planting is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the paired flower times, though the space can be optimized as we are only iterating through the arrays primarily.

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// EarliestBloom class to handle the full bloom logic
class EarliestBloom {
public:
    int earliestBloomDay(vector<int>& plantTime, vector<int>& bloomTime) {
        int n = plantTime.size();
        vector<pair<int, int>> flowers(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            flowers[i] = {bloomTime[i], plantTime[i]};
        }
        
        sort(flowers.rbegin(), flowers.rend());
        
        int currentDay = 0;
        int maxBloomDay = 0;
        
        for (auto& flower : flowers) {
            currentDay += flower.second; // Plant this flower
            maxBloomDay = max(maxBloomDay, currentDay + flower.first); // Calculate bloom day
        }
        
        return maxBloomDay;
    }
};

int main() {
    EarliestBloom solution;
    vector<int> plantTime = {1, 4, 3};
    vector<int> bloomTime = {2, 3, 1};
    int result = solution.earliestBloomDay(plantTime, bloomTime);
    cout << "Earliest possible day of full bloom: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
