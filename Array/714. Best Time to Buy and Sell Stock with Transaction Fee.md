# **[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around maximizing profit from stock trading with the added complexity of a transaction fee associated with each buy/sell operation. The goal is to derive an optimal strategy that takes into account the timing of buying and selling stocks under these constraints.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we will utilize a dynamic programming approach. We define two states:
- `cash`: the maximum profit we can have on the current day while we do not hold any stock.
- `hold`: the maximum profit we can have on the current day while we hold a stock.

The transitions between states are determined as follows:
- When not holding a stock, we can either do nothing (remain in cash) or sell the stock (if we hold it), which gives us:  
  `cash = max(cash, hold + price[i])`  

- When holding a stock, we can either do nothing (remain in hold) or buy a stock (if we are in cash), which gives us:  
  `hold = max(hold, cash - price[i] - fee)`  

We iterate through the price array and update our cash and hold states accordingly. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of days (length of the prices array). We make one pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only retain two variables (cash and hold) regardless of the input size.
