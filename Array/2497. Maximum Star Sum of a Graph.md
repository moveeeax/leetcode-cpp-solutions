# **[Maximum Star Sum of a Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-star-sum-of-a-graph/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are given a graph represented via a list of nodes where each node has a certain value. Each node can have connections (or "edges") to other nodes, which are evaluated based on their "connections" defined in an array format. The goal is to determine the maximum possible sum of values we can achieve by choosing a "star" node and connecting it to its neighbors, taking into account that we are limited to choosing a certain number of edges.  

A "star" node is defined as a node that can connect to several other nodes. The sum is maximized by adding the value of the "star" node itself and values of its connected nodes, but only if the connected node values are above a certain cutoff defined by a parameter `k`. This creates constraints on which connections we consider in our summation.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. **Initialization**: Iterate through each node and treat it as a potential "star" node.
2. **Collect and Filter Neighbor Values**: For each star node, we collect values of its neighbors from the connections and filter them using the threshold `k`.
3. **Calculate the Star Sum**: Add the value of the "star" node to the sum of valid neighbor values (those that are greater than `k`).
4. **Update Maximum Star Sum**: Keep track of the maximum sum encountered in all iterations.

This approach is efficient as we only consider each node and its connections, making it linear with respect to the number of edges and nodes.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the total connections. We go through each node and their respective list of connected nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), which is used to store the values of the neighbors.
