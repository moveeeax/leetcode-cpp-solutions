# **[Shopping Offers](https://leetcode.com/problems/shopping-offers/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around calculating the minimum cost to purchase specific items given multiple item prices, possible special offers, and a required quantity of each item. The goal is to devise a strategy to explore combinations of buying items directly versus using available offers optimally.

In essence, we need to evaluate the various combinations of how to purchase the items based on the prices of individual items and the discounts offered through special offers. The challenge is to minimize the total expenditure while ensuring we meet the exact quantities needed.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can leverage a recursive backtracking approach. The basic idea is as follows:

1. **Base Case**: If all required quantities of items are satisfied (i.e., the quantity array is zero), return the total cost incurred, which will be compared with the minimum found so far.

2. **Direct Purchase**: Calculate the cost if we decide to buy the required items at their regular prices without any offers. Recursively reduce the quantities of the items by what was just purchased.

3. **Check Offers**: For each offer, check if we can apply this offer without exceeding our requirement. If possible, reduce the required quantities based on the items in the offer and update the total cost accordingly.

4. **Revert Changes**: After exploring an offer, we must revert the quantity changes back to explore other offers.

5. **Compare Minimum Cost**: After evaluating all options (direct purchase and all offers), we check if the current total cost is the lowest found so far and update our minimum cost accordingly.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m^k), where n is the number of items, m is the number of offers, and k is the maximum quantity to purchase due to exponential possibilities of combinations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), which is mainly used for the recursion stack in backtracking.
