# **[Count Good Triplets](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-triplets/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks for counting "good triplets" in a given array of integers, where a triplet (i, j, k) is considered good if it satisfies two conditions:
1. The elements at these indices must be distinct: `arr[i] != arr[j]`, `arr[j] != arr[k]`, and `arr[i] != arr[k]`.
2. The absolute differences between the values of these elements must be bounded: `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= diff` and `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= diff`, as well as `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= diff`.

Given the constraints, a naive O(n^3) solution that checks all triplets would be inefficient for larger arrays. Therefore, an optimized approach is needed to efficiently count the valid triplets, possibly by utilizing two-pointer techniques or sorting combined with binary search.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Array**: Start by sorting the array which will help in efficiently finding valid indices for forming triplets.
2. **Using a Two-pointer Technique**: For each element `arr[j]` (acting as the middle element of the triplet), find potential `i` and `k` indices.
   - For a fixed `j`, use a modified binary search (or two pointers) to find compatible `i` (to the left) and `k` (to the right) indices that satisfy the distance constraints.
3. **Count Valid Combinations**: For each valid pair of `i` and `k` derived from the above step, calculate how many combinations can be formed.

This drastically reduces the time complexity and allows for a manageable check of the triplet conditions.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) due to the outer loop and potential inner search operations.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using constant space beyond the input array for computation.

            }
            
            // The number of valid indices i is (i + 1)
            // The number of valid indices k is (k - 1) - j
