# **[Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake I](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-cutting-cake-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves cutting a cake represented by a stick of length `n` at certain positions given in the `cuts` array. The cost of making cuts is defined by the length of the current cake segment being cut. The objective is to minimize the total cost incurred from making all the specified cuts.  

To achieve this, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach, treating the problem as a cost minimization over possible cutting sequences. Each cut can potentially affect subsequent cuts, contributing to how future segments of the cake are calculated. This means we will need to explore how to optimally partition the cake using a dynamic programming table to store the minimal costs.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Dynamic Programming Table Setup**: We will define a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to cut the segment of the cake from position `i` to position `j`.
  
2. **Base Cases**: If there are no cuts between index `i` and `j`, the cost will be zero, as making no cuts incurs no cost.

3. **Cost Calculation**: For each segment, we will attempt to make a cut at every possible position `k` between `i` and `j`. The cost of making a single cut at position `k` is simply the length of the segment being cut (`cuts[j] - cuts[i]`), and we will add the cost of the two resulting segments (left of `k` and right of `k`):
   ```
   total_cost = dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + total_segment_length
   ```
   We will take the minimum of this total cost across all possible cuts `k`.

4. **Final Output**: The final answer will be in `dp[0][m + 1]`, where `m` is the number of cuts.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m^3), where `m` is the number of cuts, due to the nested loops iterating through the cuts and calculating minimal costs.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m^2) for the DP table used to store the results.
