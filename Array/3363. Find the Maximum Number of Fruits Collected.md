# **[Find the Maximum Number of Fruits Collected](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-number-of-fruits-collected/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around collecting the maximum number of fruits from trees arranged in a straight line while observing certain constraints on the number of distinct types of fruits one can carry. Each tree has a certain type of fruit represented by a number. The goal is to calculate the largest contiguous subarray containing at most two distinct fruit types, which identifies how many fruits can be collected without exceeding the limit.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle this problem, the sliding window technique will be employed. This involves maintaining a window that expands to the right while ensuring it contains no more than two distinct types of fruits. If the window exceeds the allowed types, the left boundary will be shrunk to restore the condition. The size of this window at every stage will determine the maximum fruits collected.

1. Initialize two pointers (`left` and `right`) to manage the current window and a map to track the count of distinct fruit types within the window.
2. Expand the `right` pointer to include the next fruit in the collection and update the count of that fruit in the map.
3. If more than two types are present, increment the `left` pointer to reduce the window size until only two types remain.
4. Keep track of the maximum size of the window throughout the process, which will be our result.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of trees, as each fruit type is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only maintain a small map for at most two distinct fruits.

public:
    int totalFruits(vector<int>& fruits) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count;  // To count occurrences of each fruit
        int left = 0;                     // Left boundary of the sliding window
        int maxFruits = 0;                // Variable to track maximum fruits collected
        
        for (int right = 0; right < fruits.size(); right++) {
            count[fruits[right]]++;       // Add the current fruit to the count
            
            // Check if there are more than 2 types of fruits
            while (count.size() > 2) {
                count[fruits[left]]--;    // Remove the leftmost fruit from the count
                if (count[fruits[left]] == 0) {
                    count.erase(fruits[left]);  // Remove fruit type if count becomes zero
                }
                left++;                     // Shrink the window from the left
            }
            
            maxFruits = max(maxFruits, right - left + 1);  // Update the maximum fruit count
        }
        
        return maxFruits;  // Return the maximum fruits collected
    }
};
