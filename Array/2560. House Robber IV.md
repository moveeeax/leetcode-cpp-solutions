# **[House Robber IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iv/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In the "House Robber IV" problem, we are provided with an array representing the amount of money in a series of houses arranged in a circular fashion. The key constraints are that adjacent houses cannot be robbed on the same night, and since the houses are arranged in a circular manner, the first and last houses are also adjacent. We need to maximize the total amount of money that can be robbed while adhering to these restrictions.

The problem's essence is akin to the classic "House Robber" problem, but with the added complexity of the circular arrangement. The strategy involves deciding to either rob the first house while not robbing the last, or rob the last house while not robbing the first.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Directly handle edge cases where the number of houses is 1, 2, or 3.
   - If there is only one house, return the value of that house.
   - For two houses, return the maximum value between them.
   - For three houses, return the maximum value by considering individual robbing scenarios.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Utilize a helper function to calculate the maximum loot for a linear house arrangement, excluding specific endpoints (either the first or the last house).
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum money that can be robbed up to the current house using previous values.
   - For `n` houses, if we skip the first house, we compute the maximum money that can be robbed from the range `houses[1]` to `houses[n-1]`. Conversely, if we skip the last house, we compute the maximum from `houses[0]` to `houses[n-2]`.

3. **Compute the Result**:
   - Return the maximum value calculated from the two scenarios above.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we traverse the list of houses a maximum of two times.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only maintain a few variables to store interim results.
