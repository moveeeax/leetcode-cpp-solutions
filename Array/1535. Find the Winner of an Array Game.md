# **[Find the Winner of an Array Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-an-array-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves simulating a game between players represented by an array consisting of their numbers. The game proceeds in rounds until only one player remains, which is determined based on a set of rules that dictate which player wins in each round. The goal is to identify the ultimate winner, specifically the number that represents a player's position in the initial array.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The algorithm begins by simulating the game as described. Players compete in pairs, and the player with the higher number wins the round and moves to the next round, while the losing player is eliminated. The simulation continues until only one player remains.

- We can utilize a while loop to repeatedly remove losing players from the game.
- In each iteration, we compare pairs of players and determine the winner, which then moves on to compete in the next round.
- This process is continued until one player is left in the game.
  
### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of players, in the worst case when we have to iterate through players multiple times as players get eliminated one by one.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we modify the array in place and do not use additional space dependent on the input size.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `find_the_winner.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        return (findTheWinner(n - 1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n, k;
    cout << "Enter number of players (n) and the elimination step (k): ";
    cin >> n >> k;
    int winner = sol.findTheWinner(n, k);
    cout << "The winner is player: " << winner << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
