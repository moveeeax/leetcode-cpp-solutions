# **[Minimum Cost For Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining the minimum cost for purchasing tickets over a given set of travel days. Each ticket has a duration of validity (1 day, 7 days, or 30 days) and a corresponding cost. Our goal is to find a strategy that covers all travel days while minimizing the total expense. The travel days are provided in an ascending order, and we can take advantage of dynamic programming to build the solution iteratively.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We'll use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost required to cover the travel days up to the `i-th` travel day.
2. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0] = 0` (no cost for zero days) and initialize other elements to maximum possible values.
3. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - For each travel day, calculate the cost using three strategies based on the type of ticket chosen:
     - **1-Day Ticket**: The cost for this option would be the cost of the ticket plus the cost covering all previous days leading up to that travel day.
     - **7-Day Ticket**: Here, we need to calculate the previous day coverage where the ticket would still be valid (up to 7 days back).
     - **30-Day Ticket**: Similar to the 7-day but covers up to 30 days.
4. **Final Result**: The answer will be found in `dp[n]`, where `n` is the total number of travel days. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of travel days. We process each travel day once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing costs in the `dp` array.
