# **[Patching Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves covering all integers from `1` to `n` using a minimal number of patches (additional integers). Given an array of positive integers, we need to determine how many patches we may need to add such that we can create all integer sums from `1` to `n` in a continuous sequence. The primary challenge is to figure out the optimal method to choose patches to ensure that we can cover all the required sums up to `n`.

To understand this, let‚Äôs think about the sums we can create with the existing numbers in the array. If we can form all sums from `1` to `x`, the next number we need to deal with is `x + 1`. If `x + 1` is within the array, we can extend our range. If not, we need to patch `x + 1` into our array.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start with two variables: `maxReach` (to track the maximum integer we can achieve) initialized to `0` and `patchCount` (to count the number of patches needed) initialized to `0`.
2. **Iterate Until `maxReach` Exceeds `n`**: Use a loop to iterate as long as `maxReach` is less than `n`.
   - If the next number we require (`maxReach + 1`) is less than the current number in the existing array, we need to patch and add `maxReach + 1`.
   - If it is present, then we can utilize that number to extend our reach.
3. **Update `maxReach`**: After choosing a patch or using a number from the array, update `maxReach` accordingly.

This way, we keep track of how many additional integers (patches) we need to achieve the full range up to `n`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) in the worst-case scenario because we process each element (with O(1) checks for patches).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using only a few variables to keep track of the states.

            if (i < nums.size() && nums[i] <= maxReach + 1) {
                maxReach += nums[i++];
            } else {
                maxReach += (maxReach + 1);
                patchCount++;
            }
