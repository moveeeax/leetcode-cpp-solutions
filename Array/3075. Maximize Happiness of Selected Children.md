# **[Maximize Happiness of Selected Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-happiness-of-selected-children/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem aims to maximize the happiness of children based on selected pairs. Each child has a specific happiness value, and when they are paired, the total happiness is determined by the minimum happiness among the two children. Thus, to maximize overall happiness when choosing pairs, we need to find combinations of pairs that yield the highest possible total happiness.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Greedy Pairing**: The optimal way to maximize total happiness is to pair children with the highest happiness values to ensure that the minimum value in each pair is maximized.
2. **Sorting**: First, we sort the children's happiness values in descending order. This way, when we form pairs, the largest happiness values are used first.
3. **Pairing Strategy**: Iterate through the sorted happiness values, forming pairs from the highest values downwards. For every two consecutive children, we add the minimum of the two to our total happiness.
4. **Return Result**: Return the computed total happiness.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the number of children.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the total happiness calculation.
