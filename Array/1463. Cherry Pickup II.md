# **[Cherry Pickup II](https://leetcode.com/problems/cherry-pickup-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are tasked with finding the maximum number of cherries that can be collected by two robots starting from opposite corners of a grid and moving towards a common goal. Each robot can move either down or right and must collect cherries from the grid cells they pass through. The challenge lies in ensuring that both robots do not land on the same cell at the same time except when picking the cherries from the same cell during their joint approach.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP). We'll define a 3D DP table where `dp[row1][col1][col2]` represents the maximum number of cherries collected when robot 1 is at `(row1, col1)` and robot 2 is at `(row2, col2)`. The cells for both robots, denoted by their respective rows and columns, must not cross paths unless they are at the same cell.

**Key steps:**
1. **Initialization:** Create a 3D DP table initialized to a very small number to represent the maximum possible cherries collected.
2. **Base Case:** Start with the initial positions of the robots, taking care to collect cherries from their respective starting points.
3. **Transition:** Update the DP states by simulating all possible moves for both robots in each step.
4. **Result Extraction:** The desired result will be found in one of the last positions in the DP table, specifically those where robots have reached the last row of the grid.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(R * C^2) where `R` is the number of rows and `C` is the number of columns. This is due to potentially examining each combination of positions and the transitions in the DP table.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(C^2) as we can optimize to keep only the current and previous DP states, hence not requiring 3D space.
