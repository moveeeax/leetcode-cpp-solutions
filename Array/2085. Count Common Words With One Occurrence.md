# **[Count Common Words With One Occurrence](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-common-words-with-one-occurrence/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of words that appear exactly once in a given set of sentences. Specifically, we have two lists of strings: one containing words from a sentence and another containing a list of common words that might appear in the same context. Our task is to find and count the words that occur exactly once in the first list and do not appear in the second list (common words).

This necessitates using a frequency counter to determine the occurrence of each word efficiently, ideally with O(n) time complexity where n is the number of words.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count occurrences**: Utilize a hash map (or unordered_map in C++) to count the occurrences of each word in the first list of words.
2. **Filter unique words**: Iterate through this occurrence map to filter out words that appear exactly once.
3. **Exclude common words**: Finally, exclude any of the identified unique words that are present in the second list of common words. This will be performed using another hash map for quick look-up.
4. **Count result**: Return the count of these unique words that do not exist in the common word list.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the number of words in the first sentence list and m is the number of common words. This is due to single-pass operations to count and filter the words.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m), where we store the words and their counts in hash maps.

        for (const auto& word : words1) {
            count1[word]++;
        }
        for (const auto& word : words2) {
            count2[word]++;

        int result = 0;
        for (const auto& [word, count] : count1) {
            if (count == 1 && count2.find(word) == count2.end()) {
                result++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;

    vector<string> words1 = {"apple", "banana", "apple", "orange"};
    vector<string> words2 = {"banana", "orange"};
    
    int output = solution.countWords(words1, words2);
    cout << "Count of common words with one occurrence: " << output << endl; // Expected output: 0

    return 0;
