# **[Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-combination-with-bitwise-and-greater-than-zero/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
Given an array of integers, we need to find the largest size of a subset such that the bitwise AND of all the numbers in that subset is greater than zero. The core insight into solving this problem lies in understanding how the bitwise AND operation works. A bitwise AND between two numbers results in a number that can only retain bits that are set (1) in both numbers. Therefore, for a subset to have a non-zero AND, it must have at least one bit position where all numbers in the subset have a 1.

The strategy is to check each bit position individually across all the numbers in the array. We can count how many numbers in the array have each bit set. The maximum count of numbers that share a common bit across all numbers will give us the size of the largest combination that can produce a bitwise AND greater than zero.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We will iterate through the integers from 0 to 30 (covering all possible bit positions for 32-bit integers).
2. For each bit position, we will count how many numbers in the array have this bit set (i.e., are `1` at this bit position).
3. The maximum of these counts across all bit positions will be our answer, representing the largest combination size with a bitwise AND greater than zero.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(32 * n) = O(n), where n is the number of integers in the input array since we check 32 bits for each of the n numbers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a fixed amount of extra space that does not depend on the input size.
