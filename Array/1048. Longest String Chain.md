# **[Longest String Chain](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to find the length of the longest possible string chain from a given list of words. A string `x` can form a string chain with string `y` if `y` can be obtained by adding exactly one letter to `x`. This means that if we take each word and check if by removing one character we can get to another word in our list, we can keep track of these pairings and eventually find our longest possible chain. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort words by length**: We start by sorting the words based on their lengths. This helps ensure that when we process shorter words first, any potential longer words that could be formed by adding a character would already have been considered.
  
2. **Use dynamic programming**: We'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the longest string chain that ends with each word. We create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the longest chain that ends with the `i-th` word.

3. **Build Chains**: For each word, we will iterate through each of its characters and create potential predecessors by forming a new word with one character removed. If this predecessor exists in already processed words, we can potentially build a longer chain. Thus, we update our `dp` accordingly.

4. **Determine the Result**: Finally, the result will be the maximum value in our `dp` array, as it represents the length of the longest string chain we've found.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k^2) where n is the number of words and k is the maximum length of a word. This is due to the nested iteration of each word and then also iterating through its characters.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the DP array to store the lengths of chains for each word.
