# **[Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-groups-entering-a-competition/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of this problem is to determine the maximum number of groups that can enter a competition when the following condition is applied: the size of the groups should be increasing consecutively without any gaps. Each group must consist of at least one participant, and for `k` groups, the total number of participants must be greater than the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + k`), which is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) / 2`. We want to find the largest possible `k` such that this condition holds true given the total number of participants, `n`.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding Constraints**: Since each group requires an increasing number of participants, the number of participants required for `k` groups can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. We need to find the largest `k` such that the total number of participants `n` is greater than or equal to `k * (k + 1) / 2`.

2. **Iterative Approach**: We can start from `k = 1` and keep calculating the required participants for each successive group until the condition no longer holds true:
   - For each increment of `k`, calculate the required participants as `k * (k + 1) / 2`.
   - Check if `n` is still greater than or equal to this required count. 
   - If it is, we can increment `k` and continue, otherwise, we stop and return `k - 1` (since `k` is the first that breaks the condition).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(‚àön) - The loop will run approximately ‚àön times because the sum grows quadratically.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We are using a constant amount of extra space.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `maximum_number_of_groups.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
