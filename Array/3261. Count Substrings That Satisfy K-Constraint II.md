# **[Count Substrings That Satisfy K-Constraint II](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-that-satisfy-k-constraint-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of substrings of a given string `s` that satisfy two main constraints based on the integer `k`. Each substring must have at least one of the following conditions met:
1. The substring must have exactly `k` distinct characters.
2. The substring must have at most `k` distinct characters.

Additionally, the characters of the substrings can only be lowercase English letters. 

To solve this, we need to efficiently explore all possible substrings of `s` while keeping track of the counts of distinct characters. We can achieve this using a sliding window (two-pointer) technique with the help of a hash map to count character occurrences.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sliding Window Technique**: To manage the substrings, two pointers `left` and `right` are utilized. `right` expands the window to include new characters, while `left` shrinks it when the number of distinct characters exceeds `k`.
  
2. **Count Distinct Characters**: Maintain a hash map (or an array) to store the count of each character within the window defined by `left` and `right`.

3. **Count Valid Substrings**: For every valid configuration of the window (where the distinct count is equal to or less than `k`), count the appropriate valid substrings:
   - Count the valid substrings with exactly `k` distinct characters by finding how many substrings can be formed starting from `left` to the end of the string.
   - Count the valid substrings with at most `k` distinct characters.

4. **Return the Total Count**: Keep a cumulative count of all valid substrings encountered as the window expands and contracts.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of string `s`. Each character is processed at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the count of distinct characters since there are a limited number of lowercase letters.

                left++;
            }

            result += right - left + 1;
