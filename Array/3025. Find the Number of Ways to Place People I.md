# **[Find the Number of Ways to Place People I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-ways-to-place-people-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around arranging people in a line with certain restrictions. Specifically, we want to determine the number of ways to place `num_people` in `num_spaces` such that no two people are adjacent. This means that between each pair of people, there must be at least one empty space. The main challenge lies in efficiently calculating the arrangements given these constraints.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem:
1. **Initial Check**: First, check if it's possible to arrange the people given the spaces. If `num_people > num_spaces`, simply return `0` immediately.
2. **Calculate Effective Spaces**: Since placing `num_people` requires at least `num_people - 1` spaces between them, we can derive the number of remaining spaces available for arrangement as:
   \[
   remaining\_spaces = num\_spaces - num\_people + 1
   \]
3. **Combinatorial Counting**: The problem can be rephrased into a combinatorial one where we need to distribute the remaining spaces among the `num_people + 1` slots created (one before the first person, one between each pair of people, and one after the last person). Therefore, the task of counting the arrangements translates to selecting positions from these slots, which can be represented mathematically using combinations:
   \[
   C(remaining\_spaces + num\_people, num\_people)
   \]
   This requires computing factorial values.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for calculating factorial values (if caching is not used).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we're using a constant amount of space aside from the input.
