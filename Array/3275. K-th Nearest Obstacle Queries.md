# **[K-th Nearest Obstacle Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-nearest-obstacle-queries/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a grid (2D plane) and a series of queries where we need to find the K-th nearest obstacle from a given point (x, y). The grid is defined by a list of obstacle coordinates, and we are required to efficiently handle multiple queries to identify these nearest obstacles based on their Manhattan distance.

To clarify, the Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is defined as `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`. The core challenge lies in efficiently answering k-th nearest obstacle queries among potentially many queries to minimize performance overhead.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Storing the Obstacles**: First, obstacles are stored in a structured manner where we can access them easily for distance calculations during queries.
2. **Distance Calculation**: For each query point, calculate the Manhattan distance to each obstacle.
3. **Sorting Distances**: Once distances are calculated for each query point, they need to be sorted. From this sorted list, accessing the K-th nearest obstacle is straightforward.
4. **Efficient Query Handling**: Given that multiple queries need to be answered efficiently, sorting the obstacles relative to the query point will allow us to answer each query in logarithmic time after the initial sorting.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N + Q log Q); where N is the number of obstacles and Q is the number of queries. Sorting the obstacles takes O(N log N) and sorting the query distances takes O(Q log Q).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N + Q) for storing the distances and results where N is the number of obstacles and Q is the number of queries.
