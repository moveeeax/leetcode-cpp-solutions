# **[Report Spam Message](https://leetcode.com/problems/report-spam-message/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves analyzing a series of messages to determine which ones were flagged as spam. We have to look through the messages and see how many times each message has been reported as spam by various users. The task is to accurately count and return the highest number of times a single message has been flagged.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structure**: We'll use an unordered map to keep track of the count of reports for each unique message. This allows us to efficiently add counts and check occurrences.
2. **Iteration**: As we iterate through the list of messages:
   - For each message, we increment its count in our map.
   - While doing this, we also maintain a variable to keep track of the maximum report count encountered so far.
3. **Output**: Finally, we'll return the highest count of reports found.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of messages, since we make a single pass through the messages.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of unique messages stored in the unordered map.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `report_spam_message.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

class Solution {
public:
    int reportSpamMessage(vector<string>& messages) {
        unordered_map<string, int> reportCount;
        int maxReports = 0;
        
        for (const auto& message : messages) {
            reportCount[message]++;
            maxReports = max(maxReports, reportCount[message]);
        }
        
        return maxReports;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<string> messages = {"spam", "ham", "spam", "spam", "ham", "spam", "ham"};
    int result = solution.reportSpamMessage(messages);
    cout << result << endl; // Expected output: 4
    return 0;
}
