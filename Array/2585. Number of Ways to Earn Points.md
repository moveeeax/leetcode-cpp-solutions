# **[Number of Ways to Earn Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-earn-points/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires computing the number of ways to earn a target number of points by completing tasks. Each task has a specific point value, and the completion of each task can contribute to the total score in various combinations. In essence, the problem can be simplified to a variation of the "coin change" problem where we need to find distinct combinations of tasks (akin to coin denominations) that can sum to the target score.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We utilize dynamic programming to solve this problem. We will maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve exactly `i` points. The strategy is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Start by setting `dp[0] = 1`, since there's exactly one way to achieve zero points (by not completing any tasks).
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: For each task's point value in the task list:
   - For each potential score from the task value to the target score (inclusive), increment `dp[j]` by `dp[j - task]`. This means that the number of ways to achieve `j` points is increased by the number of ways to achieve `j - task`, as completing this task will achieve the score `j`.

3. **Result**: The result will be in `dp[target]`, which gives the count of ways to earn exactly that target number of points.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k) where `n` is the number of tasks and `k` is the target points; we iterate through all points for all tasks.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) where `k` is the target points; we only maintain a dp array of size `target + 1`.
