# **[H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The H-Index is a measure of the productivity and citation impact of a researcher. To determine the H-Index from a list of citations, we need to establish a threshold that reflects both the number of published works and their impact based on citations. The H-Index for an author is defined as the maximum value of H such that the author has published H papers, each of which has been cited at least H times.  

For instance, if an author has the citation counts `[3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`, we need to identify how many papers have at least 3 citations, how many have at least 4, and so forth, up to the highest count available.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Citations**: Start by sorting the citation list in non-decreasing order. This helps in easily counting the number of papers that meet or exceed a certain citation threshold.
2. **Iterate through Sorted Citations**: Traverse the sorted array and for each index `i`, we can calculate the potential H-Index as `n - i` (where `n` is the total number of papers).
3. **Condition Check**: If the citation at index `i` is at least `n - i`, then `n - i` is a valid H-Index. We store this value until we find the highest valid one.
4. **Return the H-Index**: The maximum valid H-Index found during the traversal will be our result.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are sorting in place and using a constant amount of additional space.
