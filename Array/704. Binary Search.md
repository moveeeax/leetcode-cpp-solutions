# **[Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is to implement the binary search algorithm which efficiently finds the index of a target value in a sorted array. Binary search operates on the principle of divide and conquer, whereby we divide the search interval in half repeatedly, making it significantly faster than a linear search, especially for large datasets. The sorted nature of the array allows us to eliminate half of the elements from consideration after each comparison.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialize Pointers**: We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, representing the current bounds of our search interval. Initially, `left` is set to 0 (the start of the array), and `right` is set to the last index of the array.

2. **While Loop**: We run a loop as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. Each iteration represents checking a middle element.

3. **Calculate Midpoint**: We calculate the midpoint index using the formula `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`, which avoids potential overflow.

4. **Comparison**: 
   - If the value at `mid` equals the target, we've found our result, and we return `mid`.
   - If the value at `mid` is less than the target, we adjust the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` (the search will continue in the right half).
   - If the value at `mid` is greater than the target, we adjust the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` (we continue searching in the left half).

5. **Not Found Case**: If the loop exits without returning an index, we return `-1`, indicating the target is not present in the array.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array due to halving the search space.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space for the pointers and mid index.
