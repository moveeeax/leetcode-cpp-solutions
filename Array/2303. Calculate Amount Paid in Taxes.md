# **[Calculate Amount Paid in Taxes](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-amount-paid-in-taxes/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to calculate the total tax amount for a given income based on a series of tax brackets. Each tax bracket specifies the maximum income that falls under it and the corresponding tax rate applied to that income segment. The task is to fill the tax amount according to the income level and tax brackets provided.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Input Parsing**: Retrieve the tax brackets and the income.
2. **Tax Calculation**: Iterate through the tax brackets to compute the tax owed based on the provided income. 
3. **Progressive Tax Calculation**: For each bracket:
   - If income exceeds the bracket threshold, calculate the tax for that portion up to the threshold.
   - If the income falls within the current bracket, calculate the tax for the remaining income and break the loop since no further brackets apply.
4. **Output the Total Tax**: Sum up all the individual taxes calculated from each bracket.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m) where m is the number of tax brackets, since we may have to iterate through each bracket at least once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a fixed number of variables to store the tax amount and do not require additional space proportional to the input size.

        for (const auto& bracket : brackets) {
            int limit = bracket[0];
            double rate = bracket[1] / 100.0;

            if (income > limit) {
                taxAmount += (limit - previousLimit) * rate;
                previousLimit = limit;
            } else {
                taxAmount += (income - previousLimit) * rate;
                break;
            }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `calculate_taxes.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `CalculateTaxes` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class CalculateTaxes {
public:
    double calculateTax(vector<vector<int>>& brackets, int income) {
        double taxAmount = 0.0;
        int previousLimit = 0;

        for (const auto& bracket : brackets) {
            int limit = bracket[0];
            double rate = bracket[1] / 100.0;

            if (income > limit) {
                taxAmount += (limit - previousLimit) * rate;
                previousLimit = limit;
            } else {
                taxAmount += (income - previousLimit) * rate;
                break;
            }
        }

        return taxAmount;
    }
};

int main() {
    CalculateTaxes calculator;
    vector<vector<int>> brackets = {{3, 50}, {7, 10}, {15, 5}};
    int income = 10;

    double result = calculator.calculateTax(brackets, income);
    cout << "Total Tax: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
