# **[Maximum Number of Eaten Apples](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-eaten-apples/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are tasked with determining how many apples a person can eat given certain constraints. The apples have a set limit on how many days they can be eaten, and the person can only eat one apple per day. Each day, they may choose to eat an apple with a specific expiration date, which reduces the available apples for subsequent days. 

The two critical factors affecting the outcome are:
- **Apples available on each day**: Represented by an array where each entry indicates how many apples are available to eat on that respective day.
- **Expiration**: Each apple has a specific date after which it cannot be consumed, leading to a situation where on the day of expiry, apples can no longer be eaten.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To efficiently track how many apples the person can eat each day while respecting the expiration dates, we will utilize a min-heap (priority queue). This will help us always access the freshest apple that has not yet expired. We will follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a max counter** to keep track of the total apples eaten.
2. **Use a priority queue** to store pairs of available apple counts and their expiration days.
3. Loop through each day:
   - For each day, add any available apples to the heap.
   - Attempt to consume one apple from the heap (ensuring it hasn't expired).
   - If we cannot consume an apple (heap is empty or all available apples have expired), the loop continues to the next day.
4. Continue until we finish all days or run out of apples to eat.
 
### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * log(k)), where `n` is the number of days and `k` is the maximum number of apples (size of the heap); due to possible enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), for storing the apples in the priority queue.
