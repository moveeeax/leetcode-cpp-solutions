# **[Best Team With No Conflicts](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-team-with-no-conflicts/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves selecting a team of players such that the sum of their scores is maximized. However, we have a constraint that no two selected players can have a conflict based on their ages. A team is considered valid if for every pair of players (A, B) chosen, A's age must be strictly less than or equal to B's age if their score is also strictly less than or equal to B's score. Our goal is to choose the maximum possible score achieving a team without conflicts.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sorting**: We start by sorting the players first by age and then by score. This way, we can ensure that once we choose a player based on their score, all subsequent players can only have scores greater than or equal to the last player added to our team.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We can use a DP array where each entry `dp[i]` represents the maximum score we can obtain by taking the first `i` players. The strategy would be to iterate through each player and find which previous players can be included in the team without conflicts, updating the DP table accordingly.

3. **Building the DP Table**: For each player `i`, we compare the player with all previous players `j` (where `j < i`). If player `j` can be included (i.e., age and score conflicts allow), then `dp[i]` gets updated to the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + score[i]`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case, due to the nested loops used to populate the DP array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the DP array.

            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                // Check for conflict. If no conflict, try to include this player.

            }
            maxScore = max(maxScore, dp[i]);  // Keep track of the maximum score
