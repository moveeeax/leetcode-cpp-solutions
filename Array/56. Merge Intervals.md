# **[Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves merging overlapping intervals in a list of intervals. Each interval is represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the starting point and the second integer is the endpoint. If two intervals overlap, we need to merge them into a single interval that covers the entire range of both intervals.  

For example, if we have intervals [1,3], [2,6], and [8,10], the first two intervals overlap, so they will be merged into [1,6]. The final result will be [[1,6], [8,10]]. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem effectively, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Intervals**: We start by sorting the list of intervals based on the starting point. This helps because we can then easily check for overlapping intervals by considering each interval in sequence.

2. **Iterate and Merge**:
   - Initialize an empty result list to hold the merged intervals.
   - Loop through each interval:
     - If the result list is empty or the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in the result, add the current interval to the result.
     - If there is an overlap, merge the current interval with the last interval in the result by updating the endpoint of the last interval to the maximum endpoint of both intervals.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, after processing all intervals, we will have the merged intervals ready to be returned.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. The sorting step dominates the overall complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the result in the worst case where no intervals overlap.

        for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
            // If merged is empty or there's no overlap, add the interval
            if (merged.empty() || merged.back()[1] < interval[0]) {
                merged.push_back(interval);
            } else {
                // Merge overlapping intervals
                merged.back()[1] = max(merged.back()[1], interval[1]);
            }
