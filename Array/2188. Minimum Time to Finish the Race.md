# **[Minimum Time to Finish the Race](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-finish-the-race/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires finding the minimum time it takes for a racer to reach the finish line given their speed, the number of laps they need to complete, and the time it takes to increase their speed. The key here is to balance between boosting speed and maintaining speed during the race to minimize the overall time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding Input and Outputs:**
   - The function will take three inputs: `timeToBoost` (time to boost speed), `totalLaps` (number of laps required), and `speedIncrease` (speed increase per boost).
   - The output will be the minimum time to finish all laps.

2. **Simulating the Race:**
   - Iterate through potential boosts (0 to maximum possible) to calculate the time taken for each scenario.
   - For each boost scenario, calculate the effective speed and remaining laps after utilizing boosts.
   - Use the formula for time calculations accounting for both time spent boosting and time racing.

3. **Iterate Efficiently:**
   - The loop will run until it becomes clear that further boosts are no longer beneficial (i.e., when the speed gains don't reduce the total time).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - where n is the number of boosts until it's no longer beneficial to continue.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - as we use a constant amount of additional space irrespective of input size.

            int lapsLeft = totalLaps - boosts; 
            if (lapsLeft < 0) break;

            // Calculate total time
            int time = boosts * timeToBoost + (lapsLeft + speed - 1) / speed;
            minTime = min(minTime, time);
        }

        return minTime;
