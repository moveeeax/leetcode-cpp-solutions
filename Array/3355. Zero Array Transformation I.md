# **[Zero Array Transformation I](https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are given an array of integers. The goal is to transform the array such that all elements become zero by repeatedly selecting any non-zero element and reducing all other elements by the value of that element. The process is performed until all elements of the array are zero. 

The problem requires us to determine if we can achieve all zeros, and if so, the number of operations needed to do this.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The key insight is to realize that every element will eventually be reduced by all previously selected non-zero elements. Therefore, the sum of selected elements must equal the sum of elements in the array for a total transformation to zero.

1. **Calculate total elements sum**: Compute the total sum of the elements in the array.
2. **Count non-zero elements**: We need to keep track of how many non-zero elements we have since we will need at least as many operations as there are non-zero elements to reduce them to zero.
3. **Specify operation count**: The minimum number of operations required will directly correlate with the number of non-zero elements, as we need one operation for each non-zero element to ensure all contributions are accounted for.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - where n is the number of elements in the array. We need one pass to compute the total sum and count non-zero elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - we only use a constant amount of space for storing the sum and the count.

            if (num != 0) {
                count++; // Count non-zero elements
            }
        }
        return count; // We need at least count operations
    }
