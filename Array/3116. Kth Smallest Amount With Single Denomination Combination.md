# **[Kth Smallest Amount With Single Denomination Combination](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-amount-with-single-denomination-combination/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to determine the Kth smallest amount that can be formed using a specified single denomination coin. We have an infinite number of coins of a specific denomination, and we can combine them in any way to create various amounts. This means that any positive integer multiple of the coin denomination is a potential amount we can achieve.

To solve this, we need to generate possible amounts from combinations of the given coin denominator and then identify the Kth smallest among them. The smallest amounts will simply be the multiples of the coin value starting from the coin value itself. The problem can be reduced to calculating K times the denomination value, as the amounts will be in the form of `denomination * 1, denomination * 2, ..., denomination * K`.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify the Coin Denomination**: We need to find the Kth small amount for the given denomination coin.
2. **Calculate Kth Smallest**: Realizing that the amounts can be formed by multiplying the coin‚Äôs denomination with integers starting from 1 up to K, the Kth smallest amount can be represented as `denomination * k`.
3. **Direct Calculation**: Since there are no other constraints given (like maximum limits), we can directly multiply the denomination coin value with K to get the desired amount.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - Only a single multiplication is performed to obtain the result.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - No additional space is utilized in the solution.
