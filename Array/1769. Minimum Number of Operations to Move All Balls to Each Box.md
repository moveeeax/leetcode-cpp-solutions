# **[Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-move-all-balls-to-each-box/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all balls to each box in a linear array where each box can either contain a ball or be empty. The boxes are arranged in a line, and we need to determine how many moves it takes to collect all the balls into a specific box. 

Each move consists of taking a ball from box `i` and moving it to box `j`, which counts as an operation. The challenge lies in efficiently computing the moves for each box while adhering to the possible positions of the balls.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We initiate two arrays: `left` and `right` for each box. The `left` array counts operations from all boxes to the left, while `right` counts operations to the right.
2. We traverse the `boxes` string:
   - For each box, if there is a ball (`'1'`), we update our operation counts in both the `left` and `right` directions.
   - For `left`, we increment the count of operations as we move leftward.
   - For `right`, we do the same in the rightward direction.
3. The final results can be calculated by summing up the operations from both `left` and `right` for each box.
4. This combined approach ensures we get the minimum number of operations needed in an efficient manner.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of boxes, as we traverse the boxes multiple times but in linear time.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the two additional arrays used to count operations for left and right sweeps.
