# **[Earliest Second to Mark Indices II](https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-second-to-mark-indices-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the earliest second at which we can confirm that all indices of an array have been marked (set to 1). This marking is based on the values in the array, which represent the seconds at which each index gets marked. The goal is to find the first second where all indices from 0 to n-1 are marked. To approach this, we need a systematic method to track which indices have been marked over time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structure**: We'll use an array `timestamps` to collect the marking times for each index as given in the input `indices`. The algorithm will iterate from 0 to m-1 (up to the maximum index present in `indices`).
2. **Tracking**: We will maintain a count of how many indices are marked. Each time we mark an index, we'll increment this count.
3. **Result Calculation**: We'll check whenever the marked count reaches the size of the input array. The first second (value) where this occurs is our solution.
   
This method will ensure we find the earliest second efficiently by keeping track of marked indices in a straightforward manner.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m) where m is the length of the `indices` array‚Äîsince we might need to iterate through `indices` once to find the first second.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is the maximum value in `indices` to track the marking of each index.
