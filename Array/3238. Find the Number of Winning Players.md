# **[Find the Number of Winning Players](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-winning-players/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine which players can win based on their scores. Each player can be compared to others to identify potential winners. The winning condition indicates that for a player to be considered a winner, their score must be strictly greater than that of at least one other player. 

To efficiently calculate the number of players with unique winning scores, we need to identify:
1. The maximum score from the player scores.
2. Count the number of players that achieved scores less than this maximum score, as these will be the only players eligible to be considered winners in comparison.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify the Maximum Score**: Iterate through the list of scores to find the maximum value.
2. **Count Scores Less Than Maximum**: Count all players who have scores strictly less than the maximum score.
3. **Construct Result**: Determine all players that achieved the maximum score and exclude them from the count, since they cannot be considered winners compared to themselves.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of players (scores). We traverse the scores a couple of times (once to find the maximum, once for counting).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a few additional variables for counting and maximum tracking.

        // Find max score and the counts of scores
        for (int score : scores) {
            if (score > maxScore) {
                maxScore = score;
                countMaxScore = 1; // reset to 1 for the new max score
                countLessThanMax = countLessThanMax; // keep previous count
            } else if (score == maxScore) {
                countMaxScore++;
            } else {
                countLessThanMax++;
            }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `find_the_winning_players.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`.  
3. **Include necessary headers**.  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**.  
5. **Compile and run the program**.
