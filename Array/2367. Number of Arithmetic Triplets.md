# **[Number of Arithmetic Triplets](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-arithmetic-triplets/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task requires us to find triplets `(i, j, k)` in the input list `nums`, such that the difference between consecutive elements is constant. Specifically, this means we need to find indices `i`, `j`, and `k` such that:

- `nums[j] - nums[i] = d`
- `nums[k] - nums[j] = d`

This implies that the values at these indices form an arithmetic sequence. To find all such triplets efficiently, we must leverage the properties of the input sequence and maintain a count of potential valid triplets.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Iterate through each midpoint**: For each element in the array, check if it can potentially be the middle element of an arithmetic triplet.
2. **Count valid pairs for each midpoint**: For each chosen midpoint, count how many suitable pairs can form the triplet.
3. **Check previous and next elements**: Use two loops to check elements before and after the midpoint to see if they can form a valid triplet according to the given condition.
4. **Efficiency considerations**: Instead of three nested loops, we can have an outer loop for the midpoint and two inner loops to find potential pairs.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) - A nested iteration where the outer loop runs n times, and the inner loops can run up to n times cumulatively.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We are only using a few extra variables, regardless of the input size.

                    for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                        if (nums[k] - nums[j] == diff) {
