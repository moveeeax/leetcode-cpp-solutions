# **[Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-value-of-even-numbers-that-are-divisible-by-three/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the average of all even numbers from a given integer list that are divisible by three. The average is calculated by taking the sum of these even numbers and dividing it by their count. If there are no such numbers, we need to return 0.

The key points to solve this problem are:
1. Iterate through the array of integers.
2. For each number, check if it is even (i.e., divisible by 2) and if it is divisible by 3.
3. Keep track of the total sum of such numbers and their count.
4. Finally, compute the average by dividing the sum by the count, or return 0 if the count is zero.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialize Variables**: Create two variables, `sum_even_div3` to store the sum of valid numbers and `count` to count them.
2. **Iterate Through the Input List**: Loop through each number in the `nums` list.
3. **Check Conditions**: For each number:
   - Check if the number is even (using modulo operator `number % 2 == 0`) and divisible by 3 (using `number % 3 == 0`).
   - If both conditions are true, add the number to `sum_even_div3` and increment `count`.
4. **Calculate the Average**: After completing the loop, if `count` is greater than zero, return the integer result of `sum_even_div3 / count`. If `count` is zero, return 0.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. We require a single pass through the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count > 0 ? sum_even_div3 / count : 0;

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `average_value.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `AverageValueOfEvenNumbersThatAreDivisibleByThree` class** inside `main()` to allow for testing.
3. **Include necessary headers**: Include `#include <iostream>` and `#include <vector>` for input/output and vector support.
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**: Read input and output the result.
5. **Compile and run the program**: Steps for compilation using g++.
