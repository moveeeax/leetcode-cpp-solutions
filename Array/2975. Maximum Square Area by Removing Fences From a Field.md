# **[Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-square-area-by-removing-fences-from-a-field/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum area of a square that can be formed by removing up to `k` fences from a given rectangular field. The physical constraints of the fence and the dimensions of the field must be taken into account, as the goal is to maximize the enclosed area of the square. 

To approach this problem, we need to evaluate the possible squares that can be formed, measuring their side lengths and calculating their areas based on the allowed number of fence removals.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify the Area Boundaries**: The field is defined by its length and width, which restrict the maximum possible square side length to the smaller of the two dimensions.
  
2. **Calculate Removals**: For any square of side \( S \), determine whether the perimeter of the square can be accommodated with the allowed \( k \) fence removals. The perimeter needed for a square is \( 4S \).

3. **Iterate Through Possible Squares**: For every possible side length \( S \) from \( 1 \) to the minimum of the field's dimensions:
   - Calculate necessary fences removed for that square to see if \( 4S \) is <= \( k \).
   - If true, update the maximum area found.

4. **Return Result**: The result will be the maximum area calculated.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(min(l, w)), where l is the length and w is the width of the field, since we iterate through potential square side lengths.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

            if (4 * side <= k) {
                maxArea = max(maxArea, side * side);
            }
