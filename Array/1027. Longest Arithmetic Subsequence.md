# **[Longest Arithmetic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in a given array of integers. An arithmetic sequence is defined as a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. For instance, the sequence [1, 3, 5, 7] has a common difference of 2. We need to consider subsequences to account for any permutation of the elements, and therefore, the order of elements in the original array is not necessarily maintained.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we can leverage dynamic programming. The main idea is to iterate through each pair of indices in the array and calculate the common difference. For each pair `(i, j)` where `i < j`, we check how many times we can extend the sequence ending at `j` by adding the current element `arr[j]`. We will maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][d]` holds the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at index `i` with a difference of `d`.  

The steps to implement the solution are as follows:
1. Initialize a map to store the longest subsequence length for each possible difference.
2. Iterate through each pair of elements in the array while calculating their difference.
3. Update the longest subsequence length for each difference found.
4. The result will be the maximum value found in the map or the dp table.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) - We use two nested loops to consider each combination of pairs in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - We use a hash map to store the lengths of arithmetic subsequences based on differences.
