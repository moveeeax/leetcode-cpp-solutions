# **[Count Elements With Maximum Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of the problem is to find the count of elements in an array that have the maximum frequency. We need to identify which element(s) appear most frequently and then count how many times these elements occur in the array. This involves tracking the frequency of each element in the input array. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Frequency Count**: We can use a hash map (or an unordered map) to count the occurrences of each number in the input array.
2. **Determine Maximum Frequency**: Once we have the frequency of each element, we can determine which frequency value is the maximum.
3. **Count Elements with Maximum Frequency**: Finally, we will count how many distinct elements have this maximum frequency.
   
The efficient way to approach this is in a two-pass method:
- First, we compute the frequencies of all elements.
- Second, we find which of those frequencies is the highest and count how many different elements have that highest frequency.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we go through the array twice: once to count occurrences and once to find max frequency.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case when all elements are unique, requiring space for storing counts.
