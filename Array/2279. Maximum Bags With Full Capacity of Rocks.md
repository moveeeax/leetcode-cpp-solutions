# **[Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-bags-with-full-capacity-of-rocks/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is centered on maximizing the number of bags that can be filled completely with rocks, given the current quantities of rocks in each bag and their respective capacities. The bags may have different capacities and some may already contain rocks. We are allowed to add rocks to any bag but we only have a limited number of rocks available to make this addition.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Calculate the required rocks**: For each bag, calculate how many more rocks are needed to fill it to its full capacity. This can be done by iterating through each bag and subtracting the current number of rocks from its capacity.

2. **Sort the requirements**: Sort the list of additional rocks needed in ascending order. This allows us to prioritize filling bags that require fewer rocks, maximizing the number of bags filled.

3. **Iterate through requirements**: Use a loop to fill bags one at a time. If we have enough rocks to fill a bag, we reduce the number of available rocks and continue to the next bag. If we run out of rocks, we break the loop as we cannot proceed further.

4. **Count the filled bags**: Maintain a counter for how many bags have been completely filled.

This approach guarantees that we fill the maximum number of bags because we always address the less rock-demanding bags first.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the number of bags. The rest of the operations are linear.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the requirements, though in in-place sorting this could be improved to O(1) for the sorting space.
