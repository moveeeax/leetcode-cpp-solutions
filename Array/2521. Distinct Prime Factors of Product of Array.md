# **[Distinct Prime Factors of Product of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-prime-factors-of-product-of-array/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the number of distinct prime factors of the product of an array of integers. Since the product can be very large, directly calculating it is impractical. Instead, we can utilize prime factorization on each individual number in the array. Each integer can be expressed as a product of its prime factors, and we only need to track which unique primes are present across all integers.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Prime Factorization**: For each number in the array, we will factor it to find all its prime factors.
2. **Using a Set**: We can use a set to store distinct prime factors. Sets inherently avoid duplication, allowing us to easily keep track of unique prime factors.
3. **Iterate through each number**:
   - For each number, repeatedly divide by all primes up to the square root of the number. This gives us the smaller prime factors.
   - If after dividing out all smaller primes, we are left with a remainder greater than 1, that remainder itself is prime and should be added to the set.
4. **Output the Size of the Set**: The number of distinct prime factors can be obtained by checking the size of the set at the end.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the length of the input array and m is the maximum number in the array. This is because for each number, we may need to check for factors up to its square root.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of distinct prime factors found, which is typically much smaller than the size of the input.
