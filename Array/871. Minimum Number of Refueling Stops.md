# **[Minimum Number of Refueling Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining the minimum number of refueling stops needed to travel a certain distance, given the starting fuel, the distances between gas stations, and the refueling capacities at each station. The challenge is to compute the least number of stops required to cover the target distance without running out of fuel.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial fuel and set up a priority queue or a max-heap to manage the refueling stations based on their capacities.
2. **Simulation**: As you traverse the distances, calculate the farthest you can reach with the current fuel:
    - If you can reach the destination without refueling, return the number of stops made.
    - If you cannot, check the refueling stations you passed and use the maximum fuel available from them until you can reach the next station or your target.
3. **Counting Stops**: Keep a counter for the number of stops made and adjust the current fuel based on the refuels chosen from the max heap.
4. **End Condition**: If at any point, you exhaust all refueling options and cannot proceed, return -1 indicating it‚Äôs impossible to reach the destination.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), because we may potentially visit each station and we are using a priority queue which takes log time for operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the distances and refueling capabilities in the worst case.
