# **[Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining how much magnetic force can be exerted between two balls positioned along a number line. Given `position`, which is an array containing the positions of the balls, and `m`, which is the number of balls to select, we need to find the maximum minimum distance that can be maintained between any two selected balls. 

The counterintuitive aspect of this problem is finding a value (the magnetic force) that is the maximum of the minimum distances between chosen balls. This can be approached using binary search to efficiently explore the possible distances.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Positions**: To facilitate checking the distances between the balls, we first sort the array of positions.
2. **Binary Search for Maximum Minimum Distance**: We will apply a binary search on the distance:
   - Set the low bound (`l`) to 1 (the smallest possible distance) and high bound (`r`) to the distance between the first and the last ball (i.e., `positions[n - 1] - positions[0]`).
   - For each mid value (possible distance), check if it's feasible to place `m` balls such that each pair of adjacent balls is at least `mid` units apart.
3. **Feasibility Check**: Starting from the first ball, iterate through the positions and attempt to place each ball. Count how many balls can be placed while maintaining the `mid` distance. If we can place at least `m` balls, then `mid` is feasible.
4. **Updating Bounds**: If placing is possible for `mid`, it means we can try for a larger distance, so we move our lower bound up. If not, we reduce our upper bound.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log(d)), where n is the number of balls and d is the distance between the farthest and closest balls.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of input size.
