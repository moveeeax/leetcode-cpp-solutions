# **[Maximum Points Inside the Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-inside-the-square/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining the maximum number of points that can fit inside or on the boundary of a square aligned with the axes in a 2D coordinate system. Given coordinates of several points, we need to find an optimal square that can contain the maximum number of these points. The side length of the square can be chosen freely, as long as the square's sides are parallel to the x and y axes. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can implement a brute force approach:
1. **Sort Points**: Start by sorting the points based on their x-coordinates. This allows us to efficiently process candidate squares.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: For each point, utilize another pointer to determine how far along the x-axis we can go while still including a square of a specific side length. This helps in fixing the left edge of the square and determining how many points can fit within it.
3. **Check Validity**: For each candidate square defined by its leftmost x-coordinate, check how many points fit within the constraints of the square's side length and y-coordinates.

The idea is to iterate through potential square positions based on the coordinates and calculate the number of points that fall within each defined square region.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of points. This happens due to the nested iteration to count points within potential square boundaries for each point.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few additional variables to store counts and coordinates.
