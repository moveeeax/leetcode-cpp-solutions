# **[Most Common Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires identifying the most frequently occurring word in a given paragraph while ignoring certain specified banned words. The results should be case-insensitive and punctuation marks must be disregarded. This means that `"Bob"` and `"bob"` should be treated as the same word, and punctuation like `','`, `'.'`, etc., should be removed from the words. The answer should be returned as a single word, and if there are ties, we return the first one that appears in the order of their appearance in the paragraph.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Normalization**: Convert the entire string to lowercase to treat the words in a case-insensitive manner. We need to remove all punctuation from the string to focus solely on the words.
   
2. **Word Splitting**: Split the normalized string into words based on spaces.

3. **Counting Frequencies**: Use a hashmap (unordered_map in C++) to count how many times each word appears, while skipping any words that are in the banned list.

4. **Identifying the Most Common Word**: After counting the frequencies, we simply need to iterate through our frequency map to find the word with the highest count.

5. **Return the Result**: Return the most common word from the frequency map.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of characters in the paragraph. We process the paragraph once to extract words and another pass to count them.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique words in the paragraph (possible maximum size of the frequency map).
