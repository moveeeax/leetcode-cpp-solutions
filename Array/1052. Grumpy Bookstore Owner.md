# **[Grumpy Bookstore Owner](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a bookstore owner who is sometimes grumpy and sometimes friendly. We have a sequence of customers and an array representing the owner's mood during each minute. The goal is to maximize the number of customers who can be served during a specific time period when the owner is grumpy, by utilizing the owner's friendly behavior for a limited duration to help mitigate the situation.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Input and Output**: We need to process an array of integers that represent the time each customer arrives and another array that represents the owner's grumpy state. The output should be the maximum number of customers that can be served.
   
2. **Calculate Total Customers**: First, calculate the total number of customers without any intervention from the grumpy state within the time interval where the owner exhibits grumpiness.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**: Utilize the sliding window technique to explore the subarray of the grumpy array where we can convert grumpy moments into friendly ones. Specifically, we will try to find a window of the length `X` (the maximum allowed time being friendly) and see how many extra customers can be served in that period.

4. **Maximize Served Customers**: Add up the served customers from the original customer count with the additional customers served during the chosen "friendly" window.

5. **Iterate through Possible Windows**: Traverse through every possible starting point of the window and keep track of the maximum additional customers served during this friendly time.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input arrays. We loop through the arrays a couple of times but do not have any nested iterations.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of additional space for counters.

```cpp
class GrumpyBookstoreOwner {
public:
    int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& customers, vector<int>& grumpy, int X) {
        int n = customers.size();
        int totalSatisfaction = 0;

        // Calculate total satisfaction when the owner is not grumpy
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (grumpy[i] == 0) {
                totalSatisfaction += customers[i];
            }
        }

        // Now find the maximum additional customers we can serve in a window of X
        int maxAdditional = 0;
        int currentAdditional = 0;

        // Sliding window for the first X minutes
        for (int i = 0; i < X && i < n; ++i) {
            if (grumpy[i] == 1) {
                currentAdditional += customers[i];
            }
        }
        maxAdditional = currentAdditional;

        // Slide the window through the rest of the array
        for (int i = X; i < n; ++i) {
            if (grumpy[i] == 1) {
                currentAdditional += customers[i];
            }
            if (grumpy[i - X] == 1) {
                currentAdditional -= customers[i - X];
            }
            maxAdditional = max(maxAdditional, currentAdditional);
        }

        return totalSatisfaction + maxAdditional;
    }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `grumpy_bookstore_owner.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `GrumpyBookstoreOwner` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**: `#include <vector>` and `#include <iostream>`  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
