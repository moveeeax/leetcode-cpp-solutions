# **[Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-increasing/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of this problem is to modify an array so that it becomes strictly increasing. A strictly increasing array means that each element is less than the next one. If the array is not already strictly increasing, we may need to modify some elements to achieve this condition. The modifications are restricted to increasing the value of the elements. We want to find the minimum number of such operations needed to make the array strictly increasing.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a simple linear scan through the array:
1. We will maintain a variable `prev` that tracks the last valid element of the new strictly increasing array.
2. We'll iterate through each element of the input array:
   - If the current element `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `prev`, it means we need to increase `nums[i]`.
   - We calculate how much we need to increase it to make it strictly greater than `prev`. Specifically, it needs to be `prev + 1`.
   - Increase the count of operations and update `prev` to `prev + 1` since we consider this new modified value.
   - If `nums[i]` is greater than `prev`, simply update `prev` to `nums[i]`.
3. Return the total count of operations after processing all elements.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We make only one pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we're using only a few extra variables regardless of input size.

            if (nums[i] <= prev) {
                operations += (prev + 1) - nums[i]; // Calculate how much we need to add
                prev += 1; // Update prev to the new value
            } else {
                prev = nums[i]; // Update prev if nums[i] is already greater
            }
