# **[Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array. This array will consist solely of 0s and 1s, and our goal is to iterate through the array to count the longest sequence of contiguous 1s. It is essential to keep track of the current count of 1s as we traverse the array and to reset this count whenever we encounter a 0. Additionally, we will need a variable to store the maximum count found during this process.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialize Two Variables**: We will create two variables: `max_count` to keep track of the maximum number of consecutive 1s we have seen so far, and `current_count` to keep track of the current number of consecutive 1s.
2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We will loop through each element in the array:
   - If the current element is 1, increment `current_count`.
   - If the current element is 0, compare `current_count` with `max_count` and update `max_count` if `current_count` is larger. Then reset `current_count` to 0 since the sequence of 1s has been interrupted.
3. **Final Check**: After exiting the loop, we need to do one last check to update `max_count` in case the longest sequence of 1s ends at the last element of the array.
4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return `max_count`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We only go through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space for our counters.

                max_count = max(max_count, current_count);
                current_count = 0;
            }
