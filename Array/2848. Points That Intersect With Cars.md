# **[Points That Intersect With Cars](https://leetcode.com/problems/points-that-intersect-with-cars/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the points that intersect with all cars on a 2D plane. Each car is represented as an interval on the x-axis, where its start and end points are specified. Our task is to find all the x-coordinates that fall within at least one of these intervals. The main challenge is to efficiently merge overlapping intervals and extract unique intersection points.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the given intervals based on their starting points. If two intervals overlap, the earlier one will ensure that the overlap is considered during merging.
  
2. **Merging Intervals**: Iterate through the sorted list of intervals and merge them into one continuous segment if they overlap. The criteria for overlap is that the start of one interval is less than or equal to the end of the last merged interval.

3. **Collecting Points**: Once we have the merged intervals, we can collect all the points that lie within these intervals. If an interval starts at `a` and ends at `b`, the points can be gathered as [a, a+1, ..., b].

4. **Returning Results**: Finally, we convert the collected points to a vector and return it as the result.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals due to the sorting step. The merging step subsequently runs in O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the output points in the worst case where no intervals overlap.
