# **[Minimum Cost of Buying Candies With Discount](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-of-buying-candies-with-discount/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we're tasked with calculating the minimum cost of purchasing candies where each candy has a specified cost and discounts are applied when buying multiple candies. Specifically, for every three candies purchased, one candy (the cheapest among the three) is free. Our goal is to calculate the total cost one would incur when making the purchases under these conditions.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To determine the minimum cost:
1. **Sort the list of costs:** By sorting the candy prices in descending order, we can simplify the application of the discount rule. The most expensive candies should ideally be purchased first, making the free candy (the least expensive in our group of three) as costly as possible to the overall cost.
   
2. **Group the candies:** We can iterate through the sorted list, grouping every three candies together. For every three candies, we add the cost of the two most expensive ones to our total since the third (the cheapest in the group) would be free.
   
3. **Handle the remainder:** If the number of candies is not a multiple of three, we must separately add the costs of any remaining candies.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - due to the sort operation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

public:
    int minimumCost(vector<int>& cost) {
        sort(cost.rbegin(), cost.rend()); // Sorting in descending order
        int totalCost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < cost.size(); ++i) {
            if ((i + 1) % 3 != 0) { // Only add cost for non-free candies
                totalCost += cost[i];
            }
        }
        return totalCost;
    }
