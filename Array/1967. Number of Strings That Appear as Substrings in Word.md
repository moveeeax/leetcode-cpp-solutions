# **[Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-strings-that-appear-as-substrings-in-word/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to determine how many strings from a given list (array of strings) appear as substrings in a specific `word` string. A substring refers to a contiguous sequence of characters within another string. For this problem, we need to count each string in the list once if it is found in `word`, regardless of how many times it may appear.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We will iterate over each string in the list of strings.
2. For each string, we will check if it exists within the `word` using the `find()` method, which will look for the substring within the main string.
3. Maintain a count of how many strings from the list are found as substrings in `word`.
4. Finally, return this count.

The algorithm's efficiency primarily depends on how many strings we have in the list and the length of the `word`. Thus with this method, we can achieve a straightforward and clear solution.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of strings in the list and n is the average length of those strings since in the worst case we perform a substring search for each string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), we are using a constant amount of space.

                count++;
            }

### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `number_of_strings.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numOfStrings(vector<string>& patterns, string word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const string& pattern : patterns) {
            if (word.find(pattern) != string::npos) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<string> patterns = {"a", "abc", "bc", "d"};
    string word = "abc";
    
    int result = solution.numOfStrings(patterns, word);
    cout << "Number of strings that appear as substrings in word: " << result << endl;  // Expected output: 3
    return 0;
}  
```
