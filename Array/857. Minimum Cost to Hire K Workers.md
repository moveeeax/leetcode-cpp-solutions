# **[Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to hire `k` workers from a list of workers, each having a cost per hour (wage) and a quality rating. The total cost to hire `k` workers is calculated based on the highest wage among the selected workers and the total quality of these workers. Our goal is to minimize the total cost while ensuring we exactly hire `k` workers. This requires a careful selection of workers based on both their quality and cost.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Pair the workers‚Äô costs with their qualities.
2. Sort the workers by their costs.
3. Use a min-heap to maintain the top `k` quality workers as we iterate through the sorted worker list.
4. Calculate the total cost using the maximum wage of the workers in the heap and the sum of their qualities.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting the workers and maintaining the heap.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) for the heap to store the quality of the `k` selected workers.

public:

        int n = quality.size();
        vector<pair<double, double>> workers(n);
        
        // Create a vector of workers with wage/quality ratio and their qualities
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            workers[i] = { (double)wage[i] / quality[i], (double)quality[i] };
        }
        
        // Sort workers based on their wage/quality ratio
        sort(workers.begin(), workers.end());
        
        priority_queue<double> maxHeap; // max heap for quality
        double qualitySum = 0; // total quality of the selected workers
        double minCost = INT_MAX; // to keep track of the minimum cost

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            qualitySum += workers[i].second;
            maxHeap.push(workers[i].second);
            
            // If we have more than K workers, remove the worker with largest quality from the heap
            if (maxHeap.size() > K) {
                qualitySum -= maxHeap.top();
                maxHeap.pop();
            }
            
            // If we have exactly K workers, calculate the cost
            if (maxHeap.size() == K) {
                minCost = min(minCost, qualitySum * workers[i].first);
            }
        }
