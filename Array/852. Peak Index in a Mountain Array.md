# **[Peak Index in a Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the peak index in a mountain array. A mountain array is defined as an array where elements first strictly increase and then strictly decrease. The peak index is the index of the maximum element, which is where the transition from increasing to decreasing occurs. 

To solve this, we need to scan through the array and identify the peak element efficiently. Given the mountain-like structure of the input, we can take advantage of a binary search approach, which will allow us to find the peak in logarithmic time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Binary Search Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning of the array (0) and `right` at the end (n-1).
2. **Middle Element Evaluation**: Calculate the middle index `mid` between `left` and `right`.
3. **Compare with Neighbor Elements**:
   - If the middle element is greater than its next element, it means we are in the decreasing section, indicating that the peak could be at `mid` or to the left (i.e., we move `right` to `mid`).
   - If the middle element is less than its next element, we are in the increasing section, indicating the peak must be to the right (i.e., we move `left` to `mid + 1`).
4. **Termination**: The process continues until `left` equals `right`, which will be the peak index when the search concludes.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

                right = mid; // We are descending
