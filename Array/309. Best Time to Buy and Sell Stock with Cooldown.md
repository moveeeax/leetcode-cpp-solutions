# **[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum profit from stock trading, given that we can make one buy and one sell. However, there is a cooldown period; if we sell a stock on day `i`, we cannot buy on day `i + 1`. Thus, after selling, the next possible buy can only occur on day `i + 2` or later. We need to track the states of our transactions (whether we hold a stock, have sold it, or are in a cooldown state) to calculate the maximum profit efficiently. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem optimally, we will use dynamic programming. We will maintain three states for each day:
1. `hold[i]`: Maximum profit on day `i` if we hold a stock.
2. `sold[i]`: Maximum profit on day `i` if we have sold a stock.
3. `cooldown[i]`: Maximum profit on day `i` if we are in a cooldown period.

The transitions between these states are as follows:
- For `hold[i]`: We can either continue holding the stock from the previous day or buy on day `i`.
  \[ hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], cooldown[i-1] - prices[i]) \]

- For `sold[i]`: We can only sell a stock that we were holding from the previous day.
  \[ sold[i] = hold[i-1] + prices[i] \]

- For `cooldown[i]`: We can either be in a cooldown from the previous day or we can sell on day `i - 1` and enter cooldown today.
  \[ cooldown[i] = max(cooldown[i-1], sold[i-1]) \]

In the end, the maximum profit will be the maximum profit from either selling or being in cooldown on the last day.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of days (the length of the prices array). Each state is computed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we will only maintain a few variables instead of an entire array.

### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock_with_cooldown.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        int hold = INT_MIN, sold = 0, cooldown = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int prev_hold = hold;
            hold = std::max(hold, cooldown - prices[i]); // Buy or carry over holding
            cooldown = std::max(cooldown, sold); // Cooldown from selling
            sold = prev_hold + prices[i]; // Sell if we were holding
        }

        return std::max(sold, cooldown); // Maximum profit in sold or cooldown states
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> prices = {1, 2, 3, 0, 2};
    int max_profit = solution.maxProfit(prices);
    std::cout << "Maximum Profit: " << max_profit << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
