# **[Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence in a given integer array. A continuous increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence of consecutive elements in the array that increases in value. For example, in the array `[1, 3, 5, 4, 7]`, the longest continuous increasing subsequence is `[1, 3, 5]` which has a length of 3.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: We will use two variables, `maxLen` to store the maximum length found and `currentLen` to keep track of the current increasing sequence length as we iterate through the array.
2. **Iterating Through the Array**: We will loop through the array:
   - For each element, we will compare it with the previous element.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, we will increment `currentLen`. 
   - If not, we will reset `currentLen` to 1 (since the current element can be considered the start of a new sequence).
3. **Updating Maximum Length**: After each comparison, we will update `maxLen` if `currentLen` exceeds it.
4. **Final Result**: The result will be stored in `maxLen` after traversing the entire array.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array, as we make a single pass through the array.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
