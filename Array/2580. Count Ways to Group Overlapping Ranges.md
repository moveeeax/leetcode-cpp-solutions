# **[Count Ways to Group Overlapping Ranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-group-overlapping-ranges/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of ways to group overlapping ranges into non-empty groups. We are given a set of ranges, and a range can overlap with others. Our task is to identify how many distinct ways we can group these ranges such that no two ranges in a single group are overlapping. 

To solve the problem, we can model the overlapping ranges using Dynamic Programming (DP). A DP array can be used where each entry indicates how many ways to group the ranges from the start up to that particular index. The key point is to determine how many previous ranges can be combined with the current range due to overlaps.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Ranges**: First, we will sort the ranges based on their starting points. This allows us to efficiently identify overlaps as we iterate through the ranges.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table. Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to group the first `i` ranges.
3. **Base Case**: The first range can only be grouped in one way, thus `dp[0] = 1`.
4. **Fill the DP Table**: For each range, check how many previous ranges it can overlap with. For ranges not overlapping, the value in the table will be directly inherited from the previous range.
5. **Modular Arithmetic**: Because the result can be very large, we take results modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, with O(n) for filling the DP table, leading to O(n log n) overall.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the DP array.

    int countWays(vector<vector<int>>& ranges) {

        int n = ranges.size();
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;  // Base case

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1]; // Case where we treat ranges[i - 1] as a new group
            
            // We will also accumulate ways from previous groups that can overlap
            int j = i - 1; // Check backwards for overlapping ranges
            while (j >= 1 && ranges[j - 1][1] >= ranges[i - 1][0]) {
                // If ranges[j-1] overlaps with ranges[i-1], we can count dp[j-1] ways
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD;
                --j;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n]; // Total ways to group the entire range set
    }
