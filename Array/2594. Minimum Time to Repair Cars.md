# **[Minimum Time to Repair Cars](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-repair-cars/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum time necessary to repair a given number of cars where each car's repair time depends on the specific car being repaired and the available mechanics. We have parameters defined as follows:  
- `cars`: An integer representing the total number of cars to be repaired.  
- `mechanics`: An integer representing the number of mechanics available.  
- `time`: An array where each element represents the time required by mechanic `i` to repair a car.

Our goal is to find a minimum time `t` such that all cars can be repaired by the available mechanics in `t` time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem efficiently, we can use a binary search approach combined with a helper function to check if a given time `t` is sufficient to repair all cars.  
- **Binary Search**: We will search for the acceptable time `t` within a range `[1, max_time * cars]`, where `max_time` is the maximum time from the `time` array.
- **Helper Function**: This function will check if `t` is sufficient by calculating the total number of cars that can be repaired by all mechanics within `t` time. For each mechanic `i`, the number of cars they can repair is calculated using `floor(t / time[i])`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * log(max_time * cars)), where m is the number of mechanics. We do binary search on the time and each check requires iterating through the mechanics.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we only use a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int repairCars(std::vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
        int l = 1, r = *max_element(ranks.begin(), ranks.end()) * cars;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            long long totalCarCount = 0;
            for (int rank : ranks) {
                totalCarCount += mid / rank;
                if (totalCarCount >= cars) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (totalCarCount >= cars) {
                r = mid; // mid is sufficient, try for a smaller time
            } else {
                l = mid + 1; // mid is not sufficient, increase the time
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> ranks = {4, 2, 3}; // Example ranks of mechanics
    int cars = 10; // Number of cars to repair
    int result = solution.repairCars(ranks, cars);
    std::cout << "Minimum time to repair cars: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
