# **[Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-initial-energy-to-finish-tasks/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining the minimum initial energy required to finish a series of tasks, each having a specific energy cost and an energy gain after completion. When planning to perform tasks, the key is to reach a state where the energy never drops below zero at any point during the process. If you start with too little energy, you risk failing to complete subsequent tasks.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of completing the tasks one by one while keeping track of the cumulative energy needed and the energy levels at each step. 

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing the total energy needed based on task requirements. 
2. **Simulation of Tasks**: For each task:
   - Check if the current energy (starting from our initial guess) is enough to complete it.
   - If it isn‚Äôt, update the initial energy needed to ensure we have enough energy to start and complete the task.
   - After completing the task, add the gained energy to our current energy.
3. **Return the final total energy**: After looping through all tasks, we can determine the minimum initial energy required.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of tasks, since we iterate through the list of tasks once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space to track energy values.

```cpp
class MinimumInitialEnergy {
public:
    int minimumEnergy(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
        int totalEnergyNeeded = 0;
        int currentEnergy = 0;

        for (const auto& task : tasks) {
            int requiredEnergy = task[0];
            int gainedEnergy = task[1];

            // If current energy is less than required energy, we need more initial energy.
            if (currentEnergy < requiredEnergy) {
                totalEnergyNeeded += (requiredEnergy - currentEnergy);
                currentEnergy = requiredEnergy;
            }

            // After completing the task, we gain the energy specified.
            currentEnergy -= requiredEnergy;
            currentEnergy += gainedEnergy;
        }

        return totalEnergyNeeded;
    }
};
