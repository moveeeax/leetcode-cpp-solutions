# **[Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence II](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem aims to find the length of the longest subsequence such that no two adjacent elements in the sequence are the same. Given an integer array, we need to form a subsequence where elements are selected from the array maintaining the above condition and ensuring that adjacent chosen elements differ. This requires checking the arrangement of groups of equal elements and how we can select them strategically.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Frequencies**: Start by counting the frequency of each number in the array using a hash map. This helps us identify how many of each element we have to potentially use.
2. **Determine Maximum Length**: The longest subsequence can be constructed by evaluating two scenarios:
   - **Selecting the maximum available frequency**: This considers how many maximum elements we can add.
   - **Alternating maximum frequencies**: For every unique element, checking how we can alternate without using the same element consecutively and maximizing the count.
3. **Special Cases**: Handle scenarios specially when only one type of number exists to avoid trivial sequences.

For each number, we can evaluate whether to include it based on its frequency compared to others.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We pass through the array once to count occurrences and once more to evaluate the possible lengths of the subsequence.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique elements stored in the map.
