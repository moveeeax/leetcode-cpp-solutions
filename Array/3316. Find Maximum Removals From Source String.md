# **[Find Maximum Removals From Source String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-maximum-removals-from-source-string/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves two strings: `source` and `target`. We are tasked with removing a maximum number of characters from the `source` string such that the `target` string can still be formed as a subsequence from the modified `source`. The goal is to determine the maximum number of characters that can be removed while still allowing for the formation of `target`.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a binary search combined with a two-pointer technique. The idea is as follows:
- The maximum number of characters that can be removed from the `source` string ranges from `0` to `source.length()`.
- We'll conduct a binary search in this range, where for each mid-value, we determine if `target` is still a subsequence of `source` after removing `mid` characters.
- To check if `target` is a subsequence of `source`, we can use a two-pointer technique. We'll iterate through the `source` and the `target` using these pointers, and if we can reach the end of `target` while matching characters in `source`, it means `target` is a valid subsequence.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log m), where n is the length of `source` and m is the length of `target`. The log m factor comes from the binary search, and we check the subsequence condition in O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), we use only a constant amount of extra space.
