# **[Stone Game VII](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-vii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem at hand is a game where two players take turns removing stones from either end of a given array of stones. Each player aims to maximize their score, which is the sum of the stones they remove. A player has the choice to remove stones from either the leftmost or the rightmost side of the array. The challenge is to determine the maximum score the first player can achieve if both players play optimally.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem optimally:
- Calculate the total sum of all stones.
- Initialize two pointers representing the left and right ends of the array.
- Use a variable to keep track of the first player's score.
- On each player's turn, decide whether to remove from the left or right based on which move yields a higher score.
- Since both players play optimally, the first player will always remove stones such that they maximize their score and minimize the potential future score for the second player.
- Loop until all stones are removed, updating the scores accordingly.

The final score for the first player will be based on the total score minus the remaining stones, ensuring that at every step, we consider the choice that gives the first player the highest potential score.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the array in linear time.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We only use a fixed amount of extra space.

        int score = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            if (total - stones[left] > total - stones[right]) {
                score += stones[left];
                total -= stones[left++];
            } else {
                score += stones[right];
