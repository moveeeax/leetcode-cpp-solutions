# **[Find The First Player to win K Games in a Row](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-first-player-to-win-k-games-in-a-row/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine which player wins the game after achieving `K` consecutive wins. We have a list representing the results of matches played, where each match's winner is indicated by an integer. The goal is to identify the first player who reaches `K` consecutive wins. If no player achieves the required consecutive wins by the end of the list, the result should signify that no player has won.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Set up variables to track the winning player and their consecutive wins.
2. **Iterate Through Results**: As we process each match result:
   - Check if the current player is the same as the last winner.
   - Increase the consecutive win count if the player remains the same.
   - If they switch, reset the count for the new player.
   - If a player reaches `K` wins at any point, return their identifier as the result.
3. **End Condition**: If we traverse the entire list without any player achieving the target wins, return `-1`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of matches. We loop through the results once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a fixed amount of extra space for our counters and identifiers.

    vector<int> players = {1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1}; // Example input
    int k = 3; // Target number of consecutive wins
    int result = solution.findWinner(players, k); // Call to the function
    cout << result << endl; // Should output 1 as player 1 wins 3 times in a row
    return 0;
