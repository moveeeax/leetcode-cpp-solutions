# **[Queries on a Permutation With Key](https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-on-a-permutation-with-key/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we are given a permutation of integers from 1 to n and a series of queries. Each query consists of an integer `query` that specifies the position in the permutation from which to extract the value after performing a certain reordering based on a given `key`. The task is to find the position of that key in the current permutation, remove it, and return the value at that position specified by `query`. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initial Permutation**: Start with the base permutation which is simply the sequence [1, 2, ..., n].
2. **Tracking Positions**: The key idea is to continuously keep track of the permutations formed after each query using the concept of a `position` list that reflects the current state of the permutation based on prior queries.
3. **Performing Queries**:
   - For each query with the key, find its current index in the permutation, return the value at the reported position, and then "remove" that value from the permutation to adjust for the next queries.
4. **Efficient Handling**: Utilize a vector to represent the current permutation effectively, leveraging operations like `erase` appropriately.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m) where n is the size of the permutation and m is the number of queries, since we may have to potentially shift elements in the permutation for each query.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) to store the permutation and its positions.
