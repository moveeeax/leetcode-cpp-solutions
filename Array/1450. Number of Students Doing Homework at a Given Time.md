# **[Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-students-doing-homework-at-a-given-time/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem asks us to determine how many students are doing their homework at a specific time, represented as an integer. Each student has a defined start and end time for their homework in two separate lists. By understanding the overlap between these time intervals, we can count the number of students who are engaged in homework at the given time.

### **🚀 Approach**  
1. **Input Structure**:
   - We are given three inputs:
     - `startTime`: A list of integers representing when each student starts their homework.
     - `endTime`: A list of integers representing when each student finishes their homework.
     - `queryTime`: An integer representing the time at which we want to count how many students are doing their homework.
   
2. **Counting Students**:
   - We can loop through each student and check if the `queryTime` lies between their respective `startTime` and `endTime`. Specifically:
     - A student is doing homework at `queryTime` if: `startTime[i] <= queryTime <= endTime[i]`.
   - We initialize a counter that increments each time a student satisfies this condition.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we return the count of students doing homework at the specified `queryTime`.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of students. We loop through each student once to check if they are doing homework.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

## **2️⃣ LeetCode Submission**  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int busyStudent(vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime, int queryTime) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < startTime.size(); ++i) {
            if (startTime[i] <= queryTime && queryTime <= endTime[i]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};  
```

## **3️⃣ Running Locally**  
### **✅ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `NumberOfStudentsDoingHomework.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`.  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **📝 Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int busyStudent(vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime, int queryTime) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < startTime.size(); ++i) {
            if (startTime[i] <= queryTime && queryTime <= endTime[i]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> startTime = {1, 2, 3};
    vector<int> endTime = {3, 2, 7};
    int queryTime = 4;
    cout << sol.busyStudent(startTime, endTime, queryTime) << endl; // Expected output: 1
    return 0;
}
```
