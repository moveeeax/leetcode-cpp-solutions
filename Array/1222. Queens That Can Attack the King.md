# **[Queens That Can Attack the King](https://leetcode.com/problems/queens-that-can-attack-the-king/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we need to find which queens on a chess board can attack a given king. The chess board is an 8x8 grid where certain cells are occupied by queens. The king is in a specific position, and we need to determine which queens can potentially attack the king based on standard chess movement rules. A queen can attack in the same row, column, or along either diagonal.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the position of the king on the board. Then, we can iterate in all possible attack directions (up, down, left, right, and all four diagonals) to check if there is a queen in those directions until we hit the edge of the board or find a queen. 

1. **Find King's Position**: Traverse through the input board to locate the position of the king (K).
2. **Directional Search**: From the king's position, search in all 8 directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
3. **Collect Queens**: For each direction, move step by step until you either find a queen or hit the boundaries of the board.
4. **Store Result**: If a queen is found, add its position to the results list.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) since the chessboard has a fixed size of 8x8, the number of operations does not depend on input size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a fixed amount of additional space for outputs.
