# **[Sum of Subsequence Widths](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subsequence-widths/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of the problem is to find the sum of the widths of all possible subsequences of a given array of integers. The width of a subsequence is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum element in that subsequence. This can become complex if we attempt to generate all possible subsequences since the task is to compute the width for potentially exponential combinations. Thus, we need an optimized approach.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem efficiently, we can take advantage of sorting. Here's the plan:

1. **Sorting**: First, we sort the array `A`. This gives us a clear view of the smallest and largest elements in any subsequence, as they will always be located at opposite ends of the sorted array.
  
2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - For each element `A[i]` in the sorted array:
     - It can be the maximum of all subsequences (which include it) that end at index `i`.
     - Similarly, it can be the minimum of all subsequences (which include it) that begin at index `i`.
   - The number of subsequences where `A[i]` is the maximum is `2^i` (since each previous element can either be included or excluded).
   - The number of subsequences where `A[i]` is the minimum is `2^(n-i-1)` (where `n` is the length of the array, and again, each subsequent element can either be included or excluded).
  
3. **Combining Results**:
   - By iterating through the sorted array and applying the contributions of `A[i]` as maximum and minimum (accounting for the above observations), we can accumulate the total width efficiently.
   - Finally, we return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to satisfy output constraints.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a few variables for calculations (disregarding the input storage).

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            total = (total + A[i] * power_of_2 - A[i] * power_of_2) % mod;
            power_of_2 = (power_of_2 * 2) % mod;
