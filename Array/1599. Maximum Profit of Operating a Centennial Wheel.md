# **[Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-of-operating-a-centennial-wheel/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to maximize the profit from operating a centennial wheel. We have two types of tickets: 
- Children tickets, which yield a profit of 'profitA' for each sold.
- Adult tickets, which yield a profit of 'profitB' for each sold.

The wheel runs for a certain number of hours 'time', and under the constraint that it can accommodate up to 'num' passengers at a time. Each operation offers an opportunity to sell one ticket to a child or an adult, but the total number of passengers operated cannot exceed the time multiplied by num.

We need to find out the maximum profit achievable by deciding how many child and adult tickets to sell given these constraints.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The solution involves a straightforward iteration over the possible number of child tickets sold, and for each case, calculate how many adult tickets can be sold based on the remaining capacity. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Calculate Maximum Passengers**: First, compute the maximum number of passengers that can be sold tickets, which is `maxPassengers = time * num`.

2. **Iterate through possible children tickets**: Loop through every possible number of children tickets from 0 to the maximum possible children tickets.

3. **Calculate remaining space**: For each count of children tickets sold, calculate the maximum that can be sold for adults based on the remaining number of passengers.

4. **Compute Profit**: For each combination of children and adults, compute the total profit.

5. **Track Maximum Profit**: Keep a running maximum for the computed profits through the iterations.

This approach ensures that all combinations of tickets are explored while remaining efficient.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(maxPassengers) ‚Äî We iterate through the possible number of children tickets.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) ‚Äî We only use a few variables for tracking profits and counts.

            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, children * profitA + adults * profitB);
