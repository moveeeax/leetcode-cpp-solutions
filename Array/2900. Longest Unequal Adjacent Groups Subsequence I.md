# **[Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem aims to determine the length of the longest subsequence from a given integer array, where no two adjacent elements in this subsequence are equal. To achieve this, one can iterate through the provided array and group contiguous elements together, counting the number of unique groups. Each group's representative element can only contribute to the subsequence if it differs from the adjacent group's representative.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can adopt the following steps:
1. **Group Contiguous Elements**: As we traverse the input array, we gather elements in groups. For example, if we have the sequence `[1,1,2,2,3,3]`, it can be grouped into `[(1,2),(2,3),(3)]`.
2. **Count Unique Groups**: Maintain a count of unique groups. If the current group is different from the last group, it contributes to the subsequence.
3. **Return Count**: Finally, return the count of these unique groups, which represents the length of the longest subsequence with unequal adjacent elements.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are not using any additional data structures that grow with input size.

            // Only increase count if current element is different from the previous one
            if (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
