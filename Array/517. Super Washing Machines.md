# **[Super Washing Machines](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-washing-machines/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem centers around managing a series of washing machines, each with a given number of clothes. Our objective is to distribute the clothes among the machines so that the time taken for the machines to become idle is minimized. The key is to balance the number of clothes across the machines, allowing for efficient washing without any one machine being overloaded. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To achieve an optimal solution, we can break down the problem into digestible parts:

1. **Calculate Total Clothes**: First, we need to compute the total number of clothes across all machines.
2. **Determine Average Load**: Calculate the average number of clothes each machine should have by dividing the total by the number of machines.
3. **Identify Excess or Deficit**: For each machine, check if it has excess clothes (more than the average) or a deficit (fewer than the average) and compute the time needed for each machine to either offload its excess or acquire the deficit.
4. **Calculate Maximum Time**: The overall time taken will be the maximum time of each machine's operation considering the balancing required and the time needed for any remaining clothes.

To implement the above logic, we'll utilize the formula:
- For machines needing to unload clothes: Calculate how long it will take for them to wash all excess clothes and become idle.
- For machines needing clothes: Calculate how long it will take for them to accumulate the required number of clothes.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We iterate through the list of washing machines a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We use a constant amount of space for variables, not depending on input size.

        int n = machines.size();
        int total = 0;
        for (int x : machines) total += x;
        
        int average = total / n; // Each machine should ideally have this many clothes
        int leftOver = total % n; // Check if there's any discrepancy in division
        
        int maxTime = 0; // Variable to keep track of the maximum time needed
        
        for (int x : machines) {
            // Time to wait for this machine to reach average if it has excess clothes
            if (x > average) {
                maxTime = max(maxTime, x - average);
            } else {
                // Time to wait for this machine to accumulate enough clothes
                maxTime = max(maxTime, (average - x + 1) / 2);
            }
        }
        
        // We need to make sure that no machine is left with any clothes
        return max(maxTime, leftOver > 0 ? n - leftOver : 0);
    }
};
