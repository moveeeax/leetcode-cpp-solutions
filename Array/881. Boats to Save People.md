# **[Boats to Save People](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about determining the minimum number of boats required to save people from a given list of weights. Each boat can carry a maximum weight and can hold at most two people. Therefore, to minimize the number of boats, we want to pair the lightest and heaviest people together, if possible, so that we utilize the weight limit efficiently.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting**: First, we will sort the list of people's weights. This allows us to efficiently pair the lightest and heaviest individuals.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: We will utilize two pointers: one starting at the beginning of the sorted list (lightest person) and one at the end (heaviest person).
3. **Checking Weights**: For each pairing, we will check if the combined weight of the two individuals at the pointers is less than or equal to the boat's weight capacity.
   - If yes, we can save both, so we move both pointers inward (increment the left pointer and decrement the right pointer).
   - If no, only the heavier person will go on a boat, so we just move the right pointer (decrement it).
4. **Count Boats**: Every time a person (or pair of persons) is put onto a boat, we increment our boat count.
5. **Termination**: The process continues until the two pointers meet.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting of weights.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using two pointers and do not require additional space proportional to the input size.

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> people = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Example input
    int limit = 5; // Max weight limit for a boat
    cout << "Minimum number of boats required: " << solution.numRescueBoats(people, limit) << endl; // Output should be computed here
    return 0;
}
