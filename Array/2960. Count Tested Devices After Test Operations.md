# **[Count Tested Devices After Test Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-tested-devices-after-test-operations/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine how many devices remain operational after a series of test operations. Each operation tests a single device, and depending on the result of that test, the operational status of that device may change. The main challenge is to efficiently count which devices remain operational after all tests are executed.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We need to iterate through the series of test operations.
2. For each test operation, check the device number being tested.
3. Maintain a state of whether each device is operational or not; if we encounter an odd number of tests for a device, it will be non-operational.
4. Once all operations are processed, count how many devices are still operational based on their state.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of test operations. We iterate through the operations once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of devices being tested. We maintain a count for each device.

        unordered_map<int, int> deviceCount;

        }
        
        int operationalCount = 0;
        for (auto& entry : deviceCount) {
            if (entry.second % 2 == 0) {
                operationalCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return operationalCount;
    }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `count_tested_devices.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

        unordered_map<int, int> deviceCount;
        
        for (int device : operations) {
            deviceCount[device]++;
        }
        
        int operationalCount = 0;
        for (auto& entry : deviceCount) {
            if (entry.second % 2 == 0) {
                operationalCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return operationalCount;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    // Example input
    vector<int> operations = {1, 2, 1, 2, 3};
    int result = solution.countDevices(operations);
    
    cout << "Operational devices count: " << result << endl; // Expected output: 1

    return 0;
}
