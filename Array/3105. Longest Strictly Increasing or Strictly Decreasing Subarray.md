# **[Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-strictly-increasing-or-strictly-decreasing-subarray/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray where all the elements are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. A strictly increasing sequence means each subsequent number is greater than the previous, while in a strictly decreasing sequence, each subsequent number is less than the previous one.

Given an array of integers, we need to traverse through it while keeping track of two variables ‚Äì one for the length of the current increasing subarray and another for the length of the current decreasing subarray. As we traverse the array, we will increment these lengths based on comparisons with the previous element. Whenever we find a break in the increasing or decreasing order, we reset the respective length counters.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Initialize two counters, `increasing_length` and `decreasing_length`, both set to 1 (since a single element is considered both increasing and decreasing).
2. Initialize a variable `max_length` to keep track of the maximum length found during the traversal.
3. Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1):
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, increment `increasing_length` and reset `decreasing_length` to 1.
   - If the current element is less than the previous one, increment `decreasing_length` and reset `increasing_length` to 1.
   - If the current element is equal to the previous one, reset both `increasing_length` and `decreasing_length` to 1.
4. Update `max_length` with the maximum of itself, `increasing_length`, and `decreasing_length` during each iteration.
5. After the loop, return `max_length` as the result.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array, because we traverse the array once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a fixed amount of extra space for storing the lengths and the maximum.
