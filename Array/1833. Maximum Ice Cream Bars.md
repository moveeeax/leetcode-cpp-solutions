# **[Maximum Ice Cream Bars](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-ice-cream-bars/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to determine how many ice cream bars can be bought given a certain amount of money and the cost of each ice cream bar. We want to maximize the number of bars purchased without exceeding the budget. 

1. We start with a bucket of money, denoted as `coins`.
2. We also have an array, `costs`, that contains the cost of each ice cream bar. 
3. Our objective is to maximize the number of ice cream bars we can buy without going over the amount of money we have.

To make optimal use of the available budget, we should aim to buy the cheaper ice cream bars first. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Costs**: We first sort the `costs` array in ascending order. This allows us to purchase the cheapest ice cream bars first, thus maximizing the number of bars bought.
  
2. **Iterate through Costs**: We then iterate through this sorted list, buying one bar at a time (if we can afford it) until we run out of money.

3. **Count the Total**: We maintain a count of how many bars we have purchased until we either exhaust our budget or run out of ice cream bars to buy.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of ice cream bar costs, due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are sorting in place and not using any additional data structures.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxIceCream(vector<int>& costs, int coins) {
        // Sort the costs to buy the cheapest bars first
        sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());
        int count = 0;

        // Iterate through the sorted costs and buy bars until we run out of coins
        for (int cost : costs) {
            if (coins >= cost) {
                coins -= cost;
                count++;
            } else {
                break; // No more money for further expensive bars
            }
        }
        
        return count; // Return the total bars bought
    }
};  
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `maximum_ice_cream_bars.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // For sort
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxIceCream(vector<int>& costs, int coins) {
        sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());
        int count = 0;

        for (int cost : costs) {
            if (coins >= cost) {
                coins -= cost;
                count++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    // Example input
    vector<int> costs = {1, 3, 2, 4, 1};
    int coins = 7;
    
    int result = solution.maxIceCream(costs, coins);
    cout << "Maximum ice cream bars that can be bought: " << result << endl; // Expected output: 4
    
    return 0;
}  
```
