# **[Range Addition II](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to apply a number of range increments on a 2D matrix initialized with zeros and then find the maximum value in the resulting matrix after all increments. Each operation allows us to increment all elements in a defined rectangular sub-region of the matrix, defined by two coordinates - the top-left and the bottom-right corners. The goal is to determine the largest element after performing all the given operations efficiently, without building the full 2D matrix.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
Instead of actually applying each operation to the matrix, we can analyze the maximum bounds affected by each operation. The key observation is that to account for the areas that a particular operation affects, we focus only on how many rows and columns are incremented through the operations. The maximum value at the end will be determined by the number of times each row and each column has been incremented.

1. **Initialization**: Start with the dimensions of the matrix `m` (rows) and `n` (columns).
2. **Finding Minimum Ranges**: The maximum number of increments we can achieve in any cell will be determined by the operation that affects the largest dimensions. Therefore:
   - Count how many `rows` can be affected by a vertical operation (minimum of total rows `m` or the number of operations `numOps`).
   - Count how many `columns` can be affected by a horizontal operation (minimum of total columns `n` or the number of operations `numOps`).
3. **Maximum Value Calculation**: The final result, which is the maximum value in the matrix after all operations, can be computed as the product of the number of affected rows and columns.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of operations since we only need to iterate through the operations once to determine the effective increments.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space, irrespective of the dimensions of the matrix or the number of operations.
