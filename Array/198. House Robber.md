# **[House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about maximizing the money a robber can steal from a series of houses, arranged linearly. Each house has a certain amount of money, but the caveat is that if the robber robs one house, he cannot rob its direct neighbors (the houses adjacent to it). The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without triggering any alarms. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
An efficient solution can be achieved using dynamic programming. The core idea is to maintain two choices at each house: either rob this house (and hence not rob the adjacent house) or skip this house and take the maximum loot from the previous ones. We can define two states:
- `rob[i]`: The maximum amount of money we can have by robbing house `i`.
- `notRob[i]`: The maximum amount of money we can have by not robbing house `i`.

The recursive relations can thus be formed as follows:
- If `i` is robbed, we get `nums[i] + notRob[i-1]`.
- If `i` is not robbed, we just take `max(rob[i-1], notRob[i-1])`.

To optimize space, we can use just two variables to hold the maximum amounts without storing the entire array.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) ‚Äî we traverse the list of houses once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) ‚Äî we are using only a constant amount of space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int robPrev2 = 0; // Represents the maximum money when robbing up to house i-2
        int robPrev1 = 0; // Represents the maximum money when robbing up to house i-1
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int current = max(robPrev1, robPrev2 + num);
            robPrev2 = robPrev1;
            robPrev1 = current;
        }
        
        return robPrev1; // After processing all houses, robPrev1 will contain the maximum money that can be robbed
    }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `house_robber.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
