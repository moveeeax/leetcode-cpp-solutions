# **[Maximum Coins From K Consecutive Bags](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-coins-from-k-consecutive-bags/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires calculating the maximum number of coins that can be collected from `k` consecutive bags, where the bags are represented by an array of coin counts. The key point is selecting the bags such that their indices are consecutive and unique. Given that bags can contain different numbers of coins, we must evaluate all possible selections of `k` consecutive bags to ensure we retrieve the maximum coins possible.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start by calculating the initial sum of coins from the first `k` bags. This gives us a baseline to compare against.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Given that we need to inspect `k` consecutive bags, we can utilize the sliding window approach. 
   - As we slide through the array of bags, update the sum by removing the coin count of the bag that is sliding out of the window and adding the coin count of the new bag that is sliding into the window.
3. **Tracking Maximum**: At each step, compare the current window sum with the maximum sum found so far, updating the maximum as necessary.
4. **Return the Maximum**: After iterating through the array, return the maximum sum found from any window of `k` bags.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of bags. Each bag is processed at most twice (once added, once removed from the sum).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a few variables for sums and indices, regardless of the input size.
