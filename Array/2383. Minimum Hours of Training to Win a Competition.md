# **[Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-hours-of-training-to-win-a-competition/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum hours of training needed for a player to win a competition. We are given two arrays: `requiredTraining` and `actualTraining`. The goal is to calculate the total hours of training needed such that, for each training session `i`, the player should train at least as much as required. If the player has already trained for session `i` but hasn't reached the required level, we need to count the deficit.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Iterate through each session**: For each training session, we compare the hours the player has actually trained with what was required.
2. **Calculate deficit**: If the actual hours trained are less than the required, we add the difference to a cumulative total of hours needed.
3. **Output the total**: Finally, we return the total cumulative training hours needed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of training sessions. This is because we are iterating through the arrays once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of additional space to store the cumulative total.

            // Train to cover energy deficit
            if (initialEnergy < energy[i]) {
                totalHours += energy[i] - initialEnergy;
                initialEnergy = energy[i]; // Update initial energy
            }
            // Deduct energy used during this session
            initialEnergy -= energy[i];
            
            // Train to cover experience deficit
            if (initialExperience <= experience[i]) {
                totalHours += experience[i] - initialExperience + 1; // +1 to beat the experience
                initialExperience = experience[i] + 1; // Become more experienced than required
            }
            // Gain experience after winning the session
            initialExperience += experience[i];
        }
        
        return totalHours;

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `minimum_hours_training.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**: `#include <iostream>`, `#include <vector>`  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
