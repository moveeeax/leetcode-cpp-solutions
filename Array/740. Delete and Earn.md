# **[Delete and Earn](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem can be likened to solving a modified version of the "House Robber" problem. Given an array of integers, the idea is to maximize the points collected by "deleting" an element from the array and all its occurrences, which in turn prevents us from collecting points from elements that are adjacent to it (i.e., the elements that are exactly one less or greater). The task is to find the optimal way to accumulate points without violating this deletion rule.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Transform the Input**: 
   - First, we will transform the input array into a new array representing the total points corresponding to each unique element. For example, if the input is `[3, 4, 2]`, we will create a new array where the index represents that number and the value at that index represents the total points from that number (i.e., the value multiplied by its occurrences).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We will implement a dynamic programming solution similar to the "House Robber" strategy. This involves maintaining two states:
     - `take`: The maximum points when including the current index.
     - `skip`: The maximum points when excluding the current index.
   - We will iterate over the array of transformed points and at each index, we will decide whether to "take" the points or "skip" them, utilizing previously stored maximum points to build our solution. The recurrence relation would be:
     - `take = skip + points[i]`
     - `skip = max(skip, take)`

3. **Implementation**:
   - At the end of the iteration, the answer will be the maximum of the last `take` and `skip` values.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + k), where n is the length of the input array and k is the maximum value in the input (to handle the points accumulation).
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), for storing points.
