# **[Find the Losers of the Circular Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-losers-of-the-circular-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we have a circular game where players are eliminated based on a counting game. Specifically, starting from player 1, we count up to `k`, and the player at that position is eliminated. The process continues until only one player remains. The objective is to determine the players who were not eliminated at any point during the game.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We initialize a boolean vector to track the eliminated players. Each index represents a player, and the value will indicate if they were eliminated (`true`) or not (`false`).
2. Using a for loop, we repeatedly eliminate players based on the counting strategy until only one player remains.
3. We need to ensure the counting wraps around using the modulo operator because the game is circular.
4. Finally, we iterate through the boolean vector and collect all players who were not eliminated.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of players, since each player is considered for elimination.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the boolean vector that tracks eliminated players.

        for(int round = 0; round < n - 1; ++round) {
            // Count k players to find the next elimination
            for(int count = 0; count < k; ) {
                current_player = (current_player + 1) % n;
                if(!eliminated[current_player]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            eliminated[current_player] = true; // Eliminate this player
        }

        // Collect the players that are not eliminated
        vector<int> losers;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if(!eliminated[i]) {
                losers.push_back(i);
            }
        }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `find_the_losers.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
