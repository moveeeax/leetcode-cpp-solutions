# **[Number of Employees Who Met the Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-employees-who-met-the-target/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining how many employees meet a specified performance target based on their individual sales contributions. We are given two arrays: one that lists the number of sales made by each employee and another that specifies the target number of sales to meet. The main task is to iterate through the sales array, count and return how many employees exceeded the target value. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start with a counter set to zero to keep track of how many employees meet or exceed the target.
2. **Iterate**: Loop through the array of sales data:
   - For each employee's sales figure, check if it is greater than or equal to the target.
   - If it is, increment the counter.
3. **Return the count**: After iterating through all employees, return the final count of employees who met or exceeded the target sales.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of employees. We only traverse the list of sales once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only use a single counter variable and no additional data structures.

public:
    int countEmployeesMeetingTarget(vector<int>& sales, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int sale : sales) {
            if (sale >= target) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `number_of_employees_who_met_the_target.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `NumberOfEmployeesWhoMetTheTarget` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class NumberOfEmployeesWhoMetTheTarget {
public:
    int countEmployeesMeetingTarget(vector<int>& sales, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int sale : sales) {
            if (sale >= target) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    NumberOfEmployeesWhoMetTheTarget solution;
    // Example input
    vector<int> sales = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int target = 30;
    int result = solution.countEmployeesMeetingTarget(sales, target);
    cout << result << endl; // Expected output: 3 (employees with sales 30, 40, 50)
    return 0;
}
```
