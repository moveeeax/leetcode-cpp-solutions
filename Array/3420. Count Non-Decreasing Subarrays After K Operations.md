# **[Count Non-Decreasing Subarrays After K Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-non-decreasing-subarrays-after-k-operations/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of non-decreasing subarrays in a given list after performing at most `k` operations. Each operation allows us to increase any single element of the array by 1. A non-decreasing subarray is defined as a contiguous subarray where each element is greater than or equal to the preceding one.

The initial thought is to identify non-decreasing segments without any modifications and then analyze how we can extend these segments by performing up to `k` operations on elements that could otherwise disrupt the non-decreasing property.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Existing Non-Decreasing Segments**: Traverse through the array to first identify the current non-decreasing sequences and their lengths.
2. **Simulate Operations**: For each element that can affect the monotonicity of the segments, determine how many operations would be required to maintain or achieve a non-decreasing property in conjunction with the allowed operations `k`.
3. **Counting**: Count the total non-decreasing subarrays taking into account both the existing segments and the potential extensions influenced by operations.
4. Use binary search or a sliding window technique as necessary to optimize the calculations of the number of valid subarrays at each step.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as we make a single pass through the list.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of additional space.
