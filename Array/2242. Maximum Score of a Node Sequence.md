# **[Maximum Score of a Node Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-of-a-node-sequence/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about calculating the maximum possible score of a sequence of nodes in a directed graph. Each node has a score, and the sequence must follow certain rules based on edges that connect the nodes. The total score of a sequence is determined by the scores of the nodes involved in it, with an important consideration that there must be an outgoing edge from the first node to the second node, and from the second node to the third node.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we need to iterate through all combinations of three distinct nodes \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) from the directed graph represented by its edges. We will:

1. **Build an adjacency list** for each node that stores the indices of nodes it can directly reach according to the given edges.
2. **Iterate through each node \(j\)** (serving as the middle node in the sequence).
3. For each node \(j\):
   - Use its adjacency list to go through each node \(i\) that can reach \(j\) (potential first node).
   - Use its adjacency list to check for each node \(k\) that can be reached from \(j\) (potential third node).
4. For each valid combination of \(i\), \(j\), \(k\), calculate the score as \(score[i] + score[j] + score[k]\) and keep track of the maximum score found.
5. Return the maximum score.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N^3)\) in the worst case because we potentially check every combination of three distinct nodes, where \(N\) is the number of nodes. Given that the number of checks can be reduced with suitable data structures, in practice it may behave better.  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N + E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges due to the adjacency list storage.
