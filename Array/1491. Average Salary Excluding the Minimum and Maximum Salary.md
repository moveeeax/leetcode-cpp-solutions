# **[Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-salary-excluding-the-minimum-and-maximum-salary/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is asking us to calculate the average salary by excluding the lowest and highest salary from a list of salaries. Given the constraints that the number of salaries is between 3 and 100, we need to find an efficient way to compute this average. The key steps involve identifying the minimum and maximum salaries, summing the remaining salaries, and computing the average accordingly.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identify Minimum and Maximum Salaries**: We will iterate through the list of salaries to find the minimum and maximum salary values.
2. **Calculate Total Sum Excluding Extremes**: As we find the min and max, we will also compute the total sum of the salaries, and subtract the found min and max values from this sum.
3. **Count Valid Salaries**: Since we excluded two values, we need to compute the average based on the total count of salaries minus 2.
4. **Calculate Average**: The average can be computed by dividing the adjusted sum (total sum minus min and max) by the count of salaries minus 2, ensuring we handle the floating point division correctly.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of salaries, since we make a single pass through the list to find the min, max, and total sum.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double average(vector<int>& salary) {
        int minSalary = INT_MAX;
        int maxSalary = INT_MIN;
        double total = 0;

        for (int s : salary) {
            total += s;
            if (s < minSalary) minSalary = s;
            if (s > maxSalary) maxSalary = s;
        }

        total -= (minSalary + maxSalary);
        return total / (salary.size() - 2);
    }
};

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double average(vector<int>& salary) {
        int minSalary = INT_MAX;
        int maxSalary = INT_MIN;
        double total = 0;

        for (int s : salary) {
            total += s;
            if (s < minSalary) minSalary = s;
            if (s > maxSalary) maxSalary = s;
        }

        total -= (minSalary + maxSalary);
        return total / (salary.size() - 2);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> salary = {4000, 3000, 1000, 2000}; // Sample Input
    double avg = solution.average(salary);
    cout << "Average Salary Excluding Min and Max: " << avg << endl; // Expected Output: 2500
    return 0;
}  
```
