# **[Minimum Number Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is centered around a game played with a list of numbers. The game involves removing numbers based on specific rules until we are left with one final number. The goal is to make sure that the last remaining number is the minimum possible. The key insight is to analyze how numbers are removed based on their position in the list. The removal process is dependent on the index of the current number being evaluated, making it necessary to derive the final answer based on how the numbers shift.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**: From the description, we observe that in each step, we select a number based on its index's parity (odd or even) and eliminate certain numbers accordingly. Specifically, numbers at even indices remain and others are discarded.
2. **Recursive Reduction**: We can recursively reduce the list of numbers by continually filtering out odds until we arrive at a single minimum number.
3. **Formulaic Resolution**: The crux of the solution lies in observing that after several operations, only specific positions will survive, allowing us to calculate the answer without iterating through every number.
4. **Final Minimization**: At the end, we need to ensure all operations maintain the minimum at each evaluation step.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We go through the numbers in a manner proportional to their count.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - The solution operates in place without requiring additional storage proportional to input size.
