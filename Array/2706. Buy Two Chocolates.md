# **[Buy Two Chocolates](https://leetcode.com/problems/buy-two-chocolates/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is to calculate the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought with a given amount of money, with the condition that if we buy two chocolates of the same type, we get one free. The strategy involves identifying the chocolate with the lowest price, since that will maximize the overall number of chocolates we can get, particularly under the offer.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initial Setup**: Read the money available and the prices of chocolates.
2. **Identify the Minimum Price**: Determine the smallest price from the price list, since buying the cheapest options will allow us to buy more chocolates.
3. **Calculate Chocolates Without Offers**: First, calculate how many chocolates can be bought without applying any offers using integer division of money by the price.
4. **Calculate Offers**: Determine the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought under the "buy two, get one free" offer. When you buy two chocolates of the cheapest type, you effectively get a third one if you have sufficient funds.
5. **Return the Result**: The maximum number of chocolates is the total chocolates that can be bought without the offer plus the number bought with the offer.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of different chocolate prices, because we need to find the minimum price.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of space for our calculations.

                minPrice = price;
            }
        }
        int chocolatesWithoutOffer = money / minPrice;
        int chocolatesWithOffer = (money - 2 * minPrice) / minPrice + 1; // Buying two chocolates and getting one free
        return max(chocolatesWithoutOffer, chocolatesWithOffer);
    }

        for (int price : prices) {
            if (price < minPrice) {
                minPrice = price;
            }
        }
        int chocolatesWithoutOffer = money / minPrice;
        int chocolatesWithOffer = (money - 2 * minPrice) / minPrice + 1;
        return max(chocolatesWithoutOffer, chocolatesWithOffer);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> prices = {1, 2, 3};
    int money = 5;
    cout << sol.buyChoco(prices, money) << endl; // Output should be 5
    return 0;
}
