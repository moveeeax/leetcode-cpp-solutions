# **[Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to minimize the number of overlapping intervals within a given collection of intervals. Each interval is defined by its start and end times, and overlapping intervals are those that share time. The challenge is to determine how many intervals must be removed in order to make the remaining intervals non-overlapping. The task is a classic example of the greedy algorithm technique, where sorting and selection based on optimal choice at each step leads us to a global optimal solution.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Intervals**: We begin by sorting the intervals based on their end times. This is crucial because if we always choose the interval that ends the earliest, we leave the most room open for upcoming intervals.
  
2. **Iterate through the Sorted Intervals**: We then traverse the sorted list and maintain a counter for the number of intervals to be removed. We also keep track of the end time of the last interval that was added to the non-overlapping set.

3. **Check for Overlap**: For each interval, if the start time is less than the end time of the last added interval, it means an overlap exists, and we increment our removal counter. If there is no overlap, we update the end time.

4. **Return the Count**: Finally, we return the number of intervals that need to be removed.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of intervals.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for counters.
