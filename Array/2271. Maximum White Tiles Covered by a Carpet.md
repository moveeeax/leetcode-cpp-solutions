# **[Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-white-tiles-covered-by-a-carpet/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about finding the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by a carpet of length ` carpetLen`. Given a series of segments on a number line, each segment represents white tiles, and we need to find the optimal position to place the carpet so that it covers the maximum number of white tiles.

The segments are represented as an array of flat tuple pairs where the first element is the starting position and the second element is the ending position of each segment. It is important to maintain the boundaries of the segments when placing the carpet.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Input Preparation**: First, we gather the segments and sort them by their starting positions. This allows us to effectively iterate through them and determine the coverage by the carpet.
2. **Two-Pointer/Sliding Window Technique**: We maintain two pointers to represent the current segment being considered and the maximum tiles covered:
   - Begin with one pointer (`cur_segment`) indicating the first segment and another pointer that progresses through segments checking how many tiles can be covered.
   - For each position of the carpet, calculate how many tiles are covered starting from that segment's start.
3. **Max Coverage Calculation**: As we slide the carpet position, calculate the number of tiles covered by:
   - Directly counting tiles within segments covered by the carpet's position.
   - Ensuring to track the cumulative tiles covered, so that when the carpet reaches the segment's endpoint, it can calculate further tiles based on its overlap with the carpet‚Äôs reach.
4. **Return Result**: Store the maximum coverage found during the iterations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), primarily for sorting the segments. The sliding window will iterate through segments in linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a fixed amount of extra space that does not grow with the input size.

            if (end > i) { // Adjust if we have included more than necessary
                int excess = max(0, (tiles[i][0] + carpetLen - 1) - tiles[i][1]); // how much past the current tile is being counted
                currentCovered -= excess;  // Remove excess counted length
            }
            
            // Update maximum coverage
            maxCovered = max(maxCovered, currentCovered);
            
            // Move the left window to the right by decrementing total covered
            totalCovered -= tiles[i][1] - tiles[i][0] + 1; // As we move the left window
        }
