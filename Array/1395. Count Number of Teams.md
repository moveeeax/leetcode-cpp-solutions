# **[Count Number of Teams](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-teams/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the number of valid "teams" of three members that can be formed from a given list of soldiers, where each soldier has a specific strength. A team is valid if all three members are either in strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order of strength. This means we can visualize the task as counting how many combinations of three soldiers we can pull from the array that either rise or fall in strength.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
The optimal way to solve this problem is through a combinatorial approach paired with careful counting:

1. **Initialization**: Create variables to count teams in increasing and decreasing orders.
2. **Iterate Over Each Soldier**: For each soldier (treated as a midpoint of possible teams), calculate the number of soldiers stronger and weaker (both ways).
   - For each soldier at index `i`:
     - Count how many soldiers to the left are stronger (`leftStronger`) and how many are weaker (`leftWeaker`).
     - Count how many soldiers to the right are stronger (`rightStronger`) and how many are weaker (`rightWeaker`).
3. **Combination Counting**: For each soldier being treated as a mid-member:
   - For a valid increasing trio involving this soldier: The number of teams formed is `leftWeaker * rightStronger`.
   - For a valid decreasing trio: The number of teams formed is `leftStronger * rightWeaker`.
4. **Total Calculation**: Sum the counts of valid teams found through iterations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of soldiers. Each soldier requires iterating through the list to count stronger and weaker members.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a few extra variables to keep counts, aside from the input storage.
