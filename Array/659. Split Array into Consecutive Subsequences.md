# **[Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to split a given array into consecutive subsequences of minimum length 3. This means we want to check if we can divide the numbers into groups where each group contains at least three consecutive integers. If we can achieve this, we should return true; otherwise, we should return false.

For example:
- Given the array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]`, we can form the subsequences `[1, 2, 3]` and `[3, 4, 5]`, thus the result will be true.
- In contrast, for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, we can't create enough consecutive sequences of length at least 3, thus the result will be false.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm with the help of a frequency map (or count map) to keep track of how many times each integer appears in the array. The key steps are:
1. Use a `map` to count the frequency of each number in the array.
2. Use another `map` to keep track of the tails of the sequences that can be formed. Each key in this map represents the last number in a subsequence.
3. Iterate through the unique numbers in ascending order:
   - If the number can be part of an existing subsequence (i.e., it can extend a sequence at a tail of `num-1`), we decrease its frequency and the tail count for `num-1`, and then increase the tail count for `num`.
   - Otherwise, if the number can start a new subsequence (i.e., it appears at least three times and has no preceding tail), we update the frequency and the tails accordingly.
   - If neither condition is met, we can't form the required sequences, and we return false.
4. If we finish checking all numbers and haven't returned false, we return true.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we essentially traverse the array a few times (for counting and processing).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the two maps used to count frequencies and track sequence tails.
