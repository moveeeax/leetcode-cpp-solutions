# **[Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about scheduling a series of jobs over a given number of days. Each job has a specific difficulty, and we are required to execute one job per day. The minimum difficulty of a job schedule is defined as the maximum difficulty of any job done on a single day across the specified number of days. We are asked to minimize this maximum difficulty while adhering to the constraints of the problem. 

The key aspects to consider are:
1. The difficulty of each job cannot be changed.
2. Each day, we can choose multiple jobs, but they must be contiguous.
3. The number of days for scheduling is fixed.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can utilize dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum difficulty of scheduling the first `i` jobs over `j` days. 

#### Steps:
1. **Initialize the DP Table**: 
   - The dimensions will be `(n+1) x (d+1)` where `n` is the total number of jobs and `d` is the number of days. 
   - Set all initial values to infinity to denote uncomputed states, except for `dp[0][0]` which should be `0` since no jobs scheduled yields no difficulty.

2. **Iterate Through Days and Jobs**: 
   - For each day `j` from `1` to `d` and each job `i` from `1` to `n`, determine the maximum job difficulty for the last segment assigned to the current day. 
   - For each potential segment end point `k` (where the last job of the previous day ends), calculate the difficulty and use previously computed values to update `dp[i][j]`.

3. **Final Result**: 
   - The final answer will be found in `dp[n][d]`, which represents the minimum difficulty for scheduling all jobs in `d` days.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2 * d) - We have a nested loop through each job and day, with additional inner loop through job segments.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * d) - The DP table of size `(n+1) x (d+1)` is required to store intermediate results.
