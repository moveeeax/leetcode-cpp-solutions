# **[Maximum Consecutive Floors Without Special Floors](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-consecutive-floors-without-special-floors/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of consecutive floors that can be visited in a building without stepping on any special floors, which are designated as off-limits. We are given a total number of floors and a list of special floors that we must avoid. The goal is to identify the longest continuous segment of floors that does not intersect with any of these special floors.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Special Floors**: First, we will sort the list of special floors. This is essential because it allows us to easily find gaps between the special floors.
2. **Calculate Gaps**: After sorting, we can calculate the distances between each pair of consecutive special floors as well as from the ground floor to the first special floor and from the last special floor to the top floor.
3. **Determine Maximum Length**: The maximum number of consecutive floors without landing on a special floor will be the maximum of the calculated gaps which represents the sections of floors that are free from special floors.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(m log m), where m is the number of special floors, due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only need a few variables to keep track of the maximum gaps found.

```cpp
class MaximumConsecutiveFloorsWithoutSpecialFloors {
public:
    int maxConsecutive(int bottom, int top, vector<int>& special) {
        // Sort the special floors
        sort(special.begin(), special.end());

        // Initialize the maximum length to 0
        int maxLength = 0;

        // Check the gap from bottom to the first special floor
        maxLength = max(maxLength, special[0] - bottom);

        // Check gaps between each pair of special floors
        for (int i = 1; i < special.size(); i++) {
            maxLength = max(maxLength, special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1);
        }

        // Check the gap from the last special floor to the top
        maxLength = max(maxLength, top - special.back());

        return maxLength;
    }
};

        int maxLength = 0;
        maxLength = max(maxLength, special[0] - bottom);
        for (int i = 1; i < special.size(); i++) {
            maxLength = max(maxLength, special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1);
        }
        maxLength = max(maxLength, top - special.back());
        return maxLength;
