# **[Two Best Non-Overlapping Events](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-best-non-overlapping-events/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find two events from a list that do not overlap and yield the maximum total profit. Each event has a defined start and end time along with an associated profit. The challenge is to ensure that the selected events do not overlap, which means the end time of one event must be less than or equal to the start time of the other.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort Events**: Start by sorting the events based on their end times. This allows us to easily iterate through the events while ensuring that we can maximize profit based on non-overlapping constraints.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a dynamic programming approach where we maintain an array to store the maximum profit achievable up to each event when considering only the current event and its non-overlapping predecessors.

3. **Binary Search**: For each event, to find the last non-overlapping event efficiently, we can use binary search on the sorted list of events.

4. **Maximize Profit**: Iterate over the events and for each event, calculate the maximum profit achievable either by including the current event (profit of the current event + maximum profit from the last non-overlapping event) or not including the current event (maximum profit achieved up to the previous event).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of events. This arises from the sorting step and binary search operations.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the DP array used to store the maximum profits.
