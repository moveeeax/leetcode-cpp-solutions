# **[Count Special Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-special-subsequences/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of special subsequences within a given binary string `s`. A special subsequence is defined as follows: it must contain at least one '0' and one '1', and all '1's must appear before any '0's in the subsequence. 

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming techniques to evaluate the number of such valid special subsequences.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: We will maintain two dynamic programming arrays/lists: `dp[0]` to track the number of subsequences ending in '1' and `dp[1]` to track the number of special subsequences.
  
2. **Iterate through the string**: For each character in the string:
   - If the character is '0': We can generate new special subsequences from all existing subsequences that end with '1'. Therefore, we add the number of previous '1' subsequences to `dp[1]`.
   - If the character is '1': We increase `dp[0]` because we can add this '1' to all previous subsequences to create new '1' subsequences.

3. **Modulo operation**: Since the number of subsequences can be large, we will return the final result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

4. **Return the result**: After processing all characters, the result will be stored in `dp[1]`, which counts the number of valid special subsequences.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We only make a single pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We only use a fixed number of extra variables.

        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '0') {
                dp[1] = (dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD;  // We can create a special subsequence out of every subsequence ending with '1'
            } else if (c == '1') {
                dp[0] = (dp[0] * 2 + 1) % MOD;  // Every subsequence can lead to a new one, and we can count the new '1' too
            }
