# **[Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to schedule jobs to maximize profit while considering their start and end times. Each job has a specific start time, end time, and profit associated with it. The key constraint is that one job cannot overlap with another when being scheduled. This leads to a classic problem that can be approached using dynamic programming combined with binary search.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Representation**: Each job can be represented as a structure that contains start time, end time, and profit. 
2. **Sort Jobs**: Start by sorting the jobs based on their end times. This allows us to consider each job and determine the maximum profit obtainable by either taking or skipping it.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We'll maintain a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum profit obtainable by scheduling jobs up to the `i-th` job.
4. **Binary Search for Non-Conflict Jobs**: For each job, use binary search to find the last job that does not conflict with the current job. This is done to accumulate profits from non-overlapping jobs efficiently.
5. **Recurrence Relation**: For each job `i`, calculate:
   - If we do not take the job `i`: profit equals `dp[i-1]`
   - If we take job `i`: profit equals `profit[i] + dp[non_conflict_index]` where `non_conflict_index` is the index of the last non-conflicting job.
   - Update the `dp[i]` to hold the maximum of the two scenarios.
6. **Final Result**: The last element of the DP array will contain the maximum profit from scheduling the jobs.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting and binary search operations, where n is the number of jobs.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the DP array.
