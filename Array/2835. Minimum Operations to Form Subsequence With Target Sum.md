# **[Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-form-subsequence-with-target-sum/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations required to form a subsequence of a given list of integers, such that the sum of the subsequence equals a provided target sum. An operation consists of selecting a number from the list, farthest from the current subsequence, and potentially adding it to the subsequence if it helps achieve the targeted sum. 

The solution primarily revolves around understanding the relationship between the elements of the list and the target sum. If we can form the sum using the elements, we will find the minimal number of elements to form the required sum.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding Subsequences**: A subsequence can be formed by deleting some elements of the list without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Utilize a dynamic programming (DP) table to keep track of the achievable sums using various counts of numbers. Essentially, the idea is to check if we can achieve the target sum using varied combinations of numbers from the input list.
3. **Using a Dictionary**: To maintain the number of ways to form different sums, a hash map will be helpful.
4. **Iterative Update**: For each number in the list, update the achievable sums and check how many operations would be needed if we were to add this number to our subsequence.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * target_sum), where n is the number of integers in the input list and target_sum represents how high the possible target sum could go.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(target_sum), as we need an auxiliary space to maintain the state of achievable sums.
