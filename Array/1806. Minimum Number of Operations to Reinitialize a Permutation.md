# **[Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-reinitialize-a-permutation/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to revert a permutation back to its original order. A permutation `arr` of length `n` can be thought of as an array that has been rearranged. The operations consist of repeatedly applying a certain transformation defined as `arr[i] = permutation[i]`. The challenge lies in figuring out how many such operations are needed to restore the original order of a sequence.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we can identify the cycles in the permutation. Each application of the transformation will shift elements along their cycle. The task is to find the least number of operations (or transformations) so all elements return to their starting positions.  

1. **Cycle Counting**: 
   - Starting from each index, traverse through its corresponding positions until we loop back to the original index.
   - Count how many positions we encounter during this traversal to form a cycle.

2. **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - For all the cycles identified, the number of operations required to realign all cycles into their starting positions is equal to the LCM of the lengths of the cycles.

3. **Implementation**:
   - We can represent the transformation as a mapping from index to index in the permutation.
   - Explore each index, marking visited indices to avoid counting the same cycle multiple times.
   - Calculate and return the least number of operations required to restore the original permutation.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Each index is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space (ignoring input).
