# **[Stone Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The Stone Game is a competitive game where two players, Alex and Lee, take turns picking stones from either the beginning or the end of a row of stones, which are represented by an array of integers. The player who picks the stones aims to collect more points than the opponent. The challenge is to prove that Alex can always win if both players play optimally. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
- Since both players play optimally, we can leverage the observation that Alex always has the first move.
- The game can be framed using dynamic programming, where we compute scores based on the choices available at each turn.
- We will maintain a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` signifies the maximum score difference Alex can achieve over Lee when considering only the stones from index `i` to `j`.
- The state transition involves considering the score when Alex picks either the leftmost or rightmost stone:
  - If Alex picks the left stone (index `i`), his score is `stones[i] - dp[i+1][j]`.
  - If Alex picks the right stone (index `j`), his score is `stones[j] - dp[i][j-1]`.
- This relationship captures the essence of the game: optimizing the score based on the remaining stones, factoring in both players' optimal strategies.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) where n is the number of stones, since we fill a 2D DP table of size n x n.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the DP table.

```cpp
class StoneGame {
public:
    bool stoneGame(vector<int>& piles) {
        int n = piles.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = piles[i];  // Base case, when there's only one pile.
        }
        
        for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                dp[i][j] = max(piles[i] - dp[i + 1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1] > 0; // If the score difference is positive, Alex wins.
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `stone_game.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `StoneGame` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1] > 0; // If the score difference is positive, Alex wins.
    }
