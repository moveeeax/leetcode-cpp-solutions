# **[Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of the problem is to find the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in an array of integers, where the difference between consecutive elements of the subsequence is fixed and given as input. This requires us to keep track of the subsequences we can build based on the provided difference, ensuring we extend them optimally to achieve the maximum length.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle this problem, we can utilize a hash map (or unordered_map in C++) that will store the lengths of valid arithmetic subsequences ending at each number in the input array, using the given difference. For each number in the input array, we will check if we can extend an existing subsequence and, if possible, update the length accordingly. 

1. Initialize a hash map to store the length of arithmetic subsequences.
2. Iterate through each number in the input array:
   - Compute the 'previous' number that would precede the current number in an arithmetic subsequence by subtracting the given difference.
   - Check if that 'previous' number exists in the hash map, and if it does, it means we can extend that subsequence.
   - Update the current number's length in the hash map accordingly.
3. Keep track of the maximum length during the iterations.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We pass through the list once and perform constant time operations with the hash map.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), which is required for the hash map to store lengths of subsequences.

            dp[num] = dp[num - difference] + 1;  // Increment from the previous number
            maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[num]); // Update maximum length found

        int maxLength = 0;

        for (int num : arr) {
            dp[num] = dp[num - difference] + 1;  // Increment from the previous number
            maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[num]); // Update maximum length found
        }
