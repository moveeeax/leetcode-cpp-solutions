# **[Count Hills and Valleys in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-hills-and-valleys-in-an-array/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count "hills" and "valleys" in a given array of integers. A hill is defined as an element that is greater than both of its neighbors, while a valley is defined as an element that is less than both of its neighbors. Thus, we will examine each triplet of adjacent elements and check the above conditions to determine if the middle element of the triplet is a hill or a valley.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start with a variable `count` initialized to zero to keep track of the number of hills and valleys.
2. **Iterate through the array**: Loop through the array from the second element to the second-last element. This is because we will be examining the current element and its two adjacent neighbors.
3. **Check Conditions**: For each element at index `i`:
   - If the element at index `i` is greater than both its neighbors, we have a hill.
   - If the element at index `i` is less than both its neighbors, we have a valley.
4. **Count Hills and Valleys**: Increment the `count` variable for each hill or valley found.
5. **Return Result**: After traversing the array, return the `count`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array, since we only do a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
