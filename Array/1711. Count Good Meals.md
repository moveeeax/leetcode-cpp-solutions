# **[Count Good Meals](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-meals/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to count "good meals," which are defined as pairs of dishes whose calorie counts sum to a power of two. Given a list of integer calorie counts, we need to find all unique pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that the sum of the calories of dishes `i` and `j` equals one of the powers of two.  

To solve this problem, we can utilize a map to count occurrences of each calorie value. After that, for each calorie count, we will check against powers of two to see if any pair can be formed. This approach is efficient as we can quickly check if the required complement (to form a power of two) exists in our map.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Precompute Powers of Two**: Since we need to check sums against powers of two, we precompute them for reasonable limits that can be expected from the sum of two calorie counts.
2. **Count Frequencies**: Use a hash map (unordered_map) to count the occurrences of each calorie count in the input array.
3. **Iterate and Calculate**: For each unique calorie count, iterate through our precomputed powers of two:
   - For each power of two, calculate the required complement (i.e., `power_of_two - calorie_count`).
   - Check if this complement is in our map:
     - If it is the same as the calorie count (self-pairing), we need to choose two distinct indices, which counts via combination formula.
     - If they are different, count the pairs formed by multiplying the frequency of both counts.
4. **Handle Duplicates and Modulo**: As we can get large counts, take results under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k), where n is the number of unique calorie counts and k is the number of powers of two checked (which is a small constant).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), required to store the frequency map for the calories.
