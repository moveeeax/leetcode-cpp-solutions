# **[Solving Questions With Brainpower](https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem at hand is about maximizing the number of questions that can be solved when dealing with two constraints stemming from each question's brainpower requirement. Each question, when solved, consumes a portion of brainpower that may affect the ability to solve subsequent questions. Our task is to devise an efficient way to traverse the list of questions while accounting for these constraints to produce the maximum count of solvable questions.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem, we can utilize dynamic programming. The main idea is to keep track of the maximum number of questions that can be solved from the current question onward. For each question, if we decide to solve it, we will move forward by skipping the number of subsequent questions corresponding to the brainpower cost of the current question. 

The key steps include:
1. Initializing a dynamic programming array where each entry represents the maximum questions solvable starting from that question.
2. Filling this array in reverse, starting from the last question moving to the first, ensuring we correctly apply the brainpower constraints.
3. The base case takes care of blank entries where no questions are left to solve.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of questions. We only iterate through the questions list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the dynamic programming array used to store results for each question.

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int points = questions[i][0];
            int brainpower = questions[i][1];
            dp[i] = max(dp[i + 1], points + (i + brainpower + 1 < n ? dp[i + brainpower + 1] : 0));
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
