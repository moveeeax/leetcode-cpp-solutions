# **[Longest Mountain in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-mountain-in-array/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to find the length of the longest mountain in an array. A mountain is defined as a sequence of elements that first strictly increases and then strictly decreases, with at least three elements (a peak and two sides). Our goal is to identify these mountain shapes within the array and return the length of the longest one. If there are no mountains, we should return 0.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this efficiently:
1. **Traverse the array**: We will iterate through the array starting from the second element and ending at the second-to-last element. This is because a mountain requires at least three elements.
2. **Check for peaks**: For each element, we will check if it is greater than its neighbors (i.e., `A[i] > A[i-1]` and `A[i] > A[i+1]`). If it forms a peak, we'll attempt to measure the mountains‚Äô lengths.
3. **Expand outwards**: Once we have identified a peak, we will expand to the left and right to find the extent of the mountain. We check while the elements are strictly increasing to the left and strictly decreasing to the right of the peak. 
4. **Calculate the length**: The length of the mountain is the difference between the leftmost and rightmost indices of the identified mountain plus 1 (to account for the peak itself).
5. **Track the longest mountain**: During the process, we'll keep track of the maximum length found.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We make a single pass through the array and, in the worst case, visit each element twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a few extra variables for tracking lengths and indices.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `longest_mountain.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `LongestMountainInArray` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
