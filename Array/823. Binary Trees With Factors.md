# **[Binary Trees With Factors](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-trees-with-factors/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves constructing binary trees consisting of integers that are factors of given numbers. Each integer can be considered as a node in a binary tree where:
- The value of a node is a factor of its parent node, and the parent node is greater than or equal to the value of the node.
- The leaves of these trees must also form the set of integers given in the input array.

The goal is to find the total number of distinct binary trees that can be constructed from the factors of the integers in the array. The answer is to be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting the Array**: 
   - Begin by sorting the input array. This helps when we want to find valid parent-child relationships since all factors will precede their multiples in a sorted array.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: 
   - Use a dynamic programming approach with a `dp` array. `dp[i]` will store the number of distinct trees that can be formed with the `i-th` value being the root.

3. **Building the DP Array**:
   - For each number in the sorted array, check all previous numbers to see if they are factors of the current number.
   - If a number `f` is a factor of the current number `num`, then you can make a tree with `f` as the parent and `num` as a child.
   - The number of ways to construct trees with `num` as root can be computed as the sum of all possible trees where each factor can be a parent. This involves multiplying the counts of trees that can be formed with the selected factors as left and right subtrees.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the result can be quite large, take modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step of the computation to prevent overflow.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array due to the nested loops to check the factors.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the `dp` array used to store the number of ways to form trees.
