# **[Max Points on a Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves finding the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line, given a set of points represented by their coordinates on a Cartesian plane. The challenge is to determine a line defined by two distinct points and check how many points can coalesce with this line. The approach would be to calculate the slope between pairs of points and count how many points share the same slope.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Handling Edge Cases**: We need to consider special cases where:
   - There are fewer than two points, returning the number of points as the result.
   - Points are duplicate; they should be counted only once.
   
2. **Calculating Slopes**: For every point, we will treat it as a base point and calculate the slope to every other point, storing the slopes in a map to track the count of points on the line defined by the base point and other points.
   
3. **Using a Map**: The slope calculation can introduce floating-point inaccuracies, so we will store slope as a pair of integers (dy, dx) where dy is the difference in y-coordinates and dx is the difference in x-coordinates, simplifying it using the greatest common divisor (GCD).

4. **Count the Points**: For each base point, we will determine the maximum number of points that can be aligned on its corresponding slope and track this to find the global maximum.

5. **Complexity**: Since we need to check all pairs of points, the overall time complexity will be O(n^2) given that for each point we may need to compute the slope with every other point.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) where n is the number of points.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the map storing slopes.
