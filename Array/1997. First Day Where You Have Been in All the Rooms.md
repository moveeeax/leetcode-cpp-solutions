# **[First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-day-where-you-have-been-in-all-the-rooms/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining the first day on which each room in a series of rooms has been visited, starting from day 0. Each room can only be accessed if we possess enough keys, which are determined by the number associated with each room. Given an initial state with access to only the first room, the goal is to calculate when we can finally enter each room for the first time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We can solve this problem using a simulation approach. The reasoning entails:
1. Initialize an array representing the days we can first enter each room. 
2. Start the visitation from room 0. 
3. For each day, mark visitation for the current room and then determine which other rooms we can access based on the keys we have collected.
4. Repeat this until all rooms have been visited.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
- Create an array `days` of size `n` initialized to zeros.
- For each day, check the rooms that can be entered based on the previous days' explorations.
- Update the `days` array for each room when they are accessed.

Given the task requirements, as long as we ensure that in each simulation step we move through rooms while keeping track of how many keys we can effectively use, we will obtain the days on which rooms have been visited for the first time.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Each room will be processed once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - We need an array to store the first access day for each room.
