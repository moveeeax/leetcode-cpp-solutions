# **[Minimum Deletions to Make Array Divisible](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-array-divisible/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
To solve the problem of determining the minimum deletions required to make an array divisible by a given `m`, we should consider the use of the greatest common divisor (GCD). If any remaining elements can be organized in such a way that their GCD with `m` results in `m`, then we can keep those elements and delete the rest.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Calculate GCD**: The primary method relies on calculating the GCD of elements in the array that can potentially be kept. We'll do this for all combinations of array elements since the result depends on the GCD with `m`.
  
2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We will iterate through the array to keep track of the GCD of elements. 

3. **Check Divisibility**: If at least one valid GCD matches `m`, we calculate how many deletions that approach would require‚Äîspecifically, those that do not contribute to GCD meeting the divisibility condition.

4. **Count Deletions**: If we determine how many items in the array can allow `m` as a divisor through their GCD, the remaining count gives us the deletions required.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the minimum deletions needed or `-1` if no arrangement can satisfy the condition.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log(m)) where `n` is the size of the array and `log(m)` is linked to the GCD calculations which can be computed in a logarithmic time with respect to the numbers involved.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are only using a few extra variables for calculations.
