# **[Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reschedule-meetings-for-maximum-free-time-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the maximum amount of free time that can be scheduled by rescheduling a series of meetings. We have two lists of meeting schedules and we want to determine the optimal placement of these meetings to maximize the time slots available for free time. 

The fundamental requirement is to integrate and merge both lists of scheduled meetings effectively, considering overlaps, to calculate the potential free time slots. The challenge lies in accurately managing the times of meetings across two different schedules and ensures accurate total free time calculation after all possible rescheduling.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Merge Intervals**: First, we need to merge both lists of meetings into a single list, taking care of overlapping intervals. This is done by sorting and then iterating through the combined meetings to merge any that overlap or touch.
  
2. **Calculate Free Time**: Once we have a list of non-overlapping meetings, we will then calculate the gaps between these meetings as our free time. We check the difference between the end of one meeting and the start of the following meeting.

3. **Summing Up Free Time**: Finally, we sum all calculated free time intervals to return the maximum free time possible after rescheduling.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the total number of meetings from both schedules. This is due to the sorting step before merging.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), primarily used for storing the merged list of meetings.
