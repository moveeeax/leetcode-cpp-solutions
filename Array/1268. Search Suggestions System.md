# **[Search Suggestions System](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves implementing an auto-suggestion system based on a search query typed by a user. Given a list of product names and a search string, we need to return a list of suggestions that match the typed prefix. The suggestions should be displayed in lexicographical order, and only the first three suggestions for each prefix should be returned. 

To solve this, we will:
1. Sort the list of products to facilitate quick lookups of suggestions that match the search string's prefixes.
2. Iteratively collect suggestions for substrings of the search string.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort the Product List**: Sorting the product list first allows us to create a structured way to find matching products as we search for prefixes.
2. **Iterate Over Each Prefix**: For each character added to the search string (i.e., keep extending the prefix from an empty string to the whole search string), we will collect matching products.
3. **Collect Suggestions**: For each prefix, iterate over the sorted product list and check if the product starts with the current prefix. Collect at most three products for each prefix and stop when we reach three suggestions.
4. **Output**: Return a list of lists, each containing three suggestions for every prefix generated from the search string.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N + M * P), where:
  - N is the number of products (due to sorting).
  - M is the length of the search string (to generate prefixes).
  - P is the average number of products returned for each prefix (up to 3).
- **Space Complexity**: O(K), where K is the number of products, for storing the suggestions.

        string prefix = "";

        for (char c : searchWord) {
            prefix += c; // Build the prefix progressively
            vector<string> currentSuggestions;
            for (const string& product : products) {
                // Check if the product starts with the current prefix
                if (product.find(prefix) == 0) {
                    currentSuggestions.push_back(product); // Add to suggestions
                    if (currentSuggestions.size() == 3) break; // Limit to 3 suggestions
                }
            }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `search_suggestions_system.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
