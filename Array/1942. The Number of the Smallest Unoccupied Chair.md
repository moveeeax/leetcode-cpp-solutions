# **[The Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-the-smallest-unoccupied-chair/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves tracking the smallest chair number that is unoccupied in a given scenario with several people arriving one-by-one. Each person occupies a chair when they arrive, and they may arrive at different times. The goal is to determine which chair is the smallest number that remains unoccupied after all people have arrived.

The input consists of the arrival times of the people and we need to return the number of the smallest unoccupied chair by the time all people are seated. The smallest unoccupied chair number is determined by checking which numbers are occupied by individuals as they arrive.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting and Simulating Arrival**: Keep track of the chairs that people will occupy. As each person arrives at a certain time and occupies a chair, maintain a record of which chairs are occupied.
  
2. **Using a Set for Occupied Chairs**: Utilize a set to hold the occupied chair numbers, as adding and checking if a chair number is occupied can be done in average O(1) time complexity with a hash set.

3. **Finding the Smallest Unoccupied Chair**: After processing all arrivals, start from chair number 0 and find the smallest chair number that is not in the set.

This approach ensures we efficiently find out which chair remains unoccupied after each person arrives.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting of arrival times. O(n) for iterating through the occupied chairs to find the smallest unoccupied chair.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) since we use a set to keep track of occupied chairs.
