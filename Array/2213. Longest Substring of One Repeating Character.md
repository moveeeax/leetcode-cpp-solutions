# **[Longest Substring of One Repeating Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-of-one-repeating-character/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to find the length of the longest substring that consists of only one type of character. For example, in the string "aaabb", the longest substring is "aaa", which has a length of 3. The goal is to iterate through the string while keeping track of the current character and its count. If the character changes, we compare the count of the previous character with our maximum length recorded and update accordingly.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a simple linear scan through the string:
1. **Initialize** two variables: one to keep track of the maximum length of a repeating character substring (`max_length`) and another to track the count of the current repeating character (`current_length`).
2. **Iterate** through the string using a loop:
   - If the current character is the same as the previous one, increment the `current_length`.
   - If it differs, compare the `current_length` with `max_length` and update `max_length` if necessary, then reset `current_length` to 1.
3. After exiting the loop, we need to perform a final comparison in case the longest substring ends at the end of the string.
4. Return the `max_length` found.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space for the length counters.

        int max_length = 0, current_length = 0;
        char last_char = 0;
        
        for (char c : text) {
            // If we see the same character as last, continue the current count
            if (c == last_char) {
                current_length++;
            } else {
                // Update max length with the current repeating characters count
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length);
                current_length = 1; // Reset for the new character
                last_char = c; // Set the last character to current
            }
        }
        
        // Check for the last counted characters
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length);

        // Since we can replace one character, we just need to check if there's any other character present
        return max_length + (count(text.begin(), text.end(), last_char) > current_length ? 1 : 0);
    }
};
```
