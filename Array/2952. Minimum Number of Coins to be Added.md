# **[Minimum Number of Coins to be Added](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-coins-to-be-added/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves finding the minimum number of additional coins required to make a certain amount when given a set of coins of specific denominations. This can be understood as solving a "coin change" problem where we want to determine the gap or difference in value that needs to be filled to reach a desired amount. 

The main challenge is to determine how many coins we need to add so that the total value of our coins matches or exceeds a given target amount. The number of coins we need to add to achieve this is crucial and will be our answer.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initial Setup**: Start by calculating the total value of the coins we currently have.
2. **Compare with Target**: Check how much more we need to reach the specified target amount.
3. **Determine Additional Coins**: If the current total is less than the target, the difference will indicate the amount that needs to be made up with more coins. 
4. **Result**: The result will be the smallest number of additional coins needed to cover this difference.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of coins, since we need to traverse the list once to calculate the sum.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space for our calculations.

public:
    int addMinCoins(vector<int>& coins, int target) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            total += coin;
        }
        if (total >= target) {
            return 0;
        }
        return target - total;
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `minimum_coins.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `MinimumCoins` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class MinimumCoins {
public:
    int addMinCoins(vector<int>& coins, int target) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            total += coin;
        }
        if (total >= target) {
            return 0;
        }
        return target - total;
    }
};

int main() {
    MinimumCoins solution;
    vector<int> coins = {1, 2, 3}; // Example coins
    int target = 10; // Example target amount
    cout << "Minimum coins to be added: " << solution.addMinCoins(coins, target) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
