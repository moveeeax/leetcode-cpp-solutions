# **[Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to find the number of longest increasing subsequences (LIS) in a given array. An increasing subsequence can be formed by taking elements from the array such that each element is larger than the previous one, and we want to count how many distinct ways we can create the longest such subsequence(s).  

To solve this problem, we need to do two things:
1. Determine the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
2. Count how many different ways we can form such subsequences.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
We can use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently. The key idea is to maintain two arrays:
- `lengths[]`: to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.
- `counts[]`: to store the number of longest increasing subsequences that end at each index.

The steps are as follows:
1. Initialize the `lengths` array with all 1s, since the minimum length for any element is 1 (the element itself).
2. Initialize the `counts` array with all 1s, since each element can form a subsequence on its own.
3. Iterate through the array with two nested loops:
   - For each element, check all previous elements to see if you can form a longer subsequence by appending the current element.
   - Update the `lengths` array and the `counts` array accordingly.
4. Finally, find the maximum length in the `lengths` array and sum up all the counts corresponding to that maximum length.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This arises from the nested loop structure.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the two additional arrays used to store lengths and counts.
