# **[Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves Koko, who needs to eat all the bananas available in various piles over a certain number of hours. The piles are represented as an array, where each element indicates the number of bananas in that pile. Koko can eat bananas at a fixed rate `K`, and if that rate is insufficient to finish all bananas in the given hours, we need to increase `K`. The main goal is to find the minimum integer speed `K` such that Koko can finish all bananas within `H` hours.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understanding the task**: We need to find the minimum `K` such that the total time taken to eat all the bananas with speed `K` does not exceed `H` hours.
  
2. **Binary Search**: We'll use binary search to efficiently find the smallest possible value of `K`:
   - Set the lower limit (`left`) to 1 (minimum speed).
   - Set the upper limit (`right`) to the maximum number of bananas in any pile since, at worst, Koko might eat the largest pile of bananas in one hour.
   - The mid-point `K` will be computed in each iteration, and we'll check if Koko can finish all bananas within `H` hours at that speed.
  
3. **Time Calculation**: For a fixed `K`, calculate the total time required by iterating over each pile:
   - If a pile has `pile` bananas, the time to finish that pile at speed `K` is `(pile + K - 1) / K`, which effectively computes the ceiling of `pile / K`.
   - Accumulate this time over all piles and check if it exceeds `H`.

4. **Binary Search Steps**:
   - If Koko can finish in time, update the result and move to the left (decrease `K`); otherwise, move to the right (increase `K`).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log M), where N is the number of piles and M is the maximum number of bananas in a pile (the upper limit for `K`).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we're using a constant amount of space.

                left = mid + 1; // Koko can't finish in H hours at speed mid, try larger
            }
        }
        return left; // left is the minimum K where Koko can eat all bananas
