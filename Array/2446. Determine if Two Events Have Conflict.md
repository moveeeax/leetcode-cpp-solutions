# **[Determine if Two Events Have Conflict](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-events-have-conflict/description/)**  

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**  
### **📌 Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine if two events overlap in time. Each event is defined by a start and an end time. We need to check if the time intervals of two events intersect. This is crucial in applications where scheduling events or meetings is involved to avoid conflicts.

### **🚀 Approach**  
To solve the problem, we can define two intervals representing the two events:
- Event 1: `[start1, end1]`
- Event 2: `[start2, end2]`

The events will overlap if:
1. The start of one event falls within the time range of the other event, or
2. The end of one event falls within the time range of the other event.

In terms of condition checks, the overlapping can be determined by verifying the following:
- If `start1 <= end2` (Event 1 starts before Event 2 ends) AND `start2 <= end1` (Event 2 starts before Event 1 ends).

If both conditions are satisfied, then there is a conflict between the two events.

### **⏱️ Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - The solution involves a constant number of operations, regardless of the size of input.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - No additional space is used apart from a few variables.

## **3️⃣ Running Locally**  
### **✅ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `solution.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool haveConflict(vector<string>& event1, vector<string>& event2) {
        return !(event1[1] < event2[0] || event2[1] < event1[0]);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<string> event1 = {"01:00", "02:00"};
    vector<string> event2 = {"01:30", "02:30"};
    if (sol.haveConflict(event1, event2)) {
        cout << "Events conflict." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Events do not conflict." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
