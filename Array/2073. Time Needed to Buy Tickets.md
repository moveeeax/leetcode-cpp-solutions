# **[Time Needed to Buy Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-buy-tickets/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves simulating the process of buying tickets in a queue. Each person in the queue has a certain number of tickets they want to buy, and they only start buying tickets after all previous people in front of them have finished. The goal is to determine the total time it will take for a specific person (indexed by `k`) to finish buying their tickets.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. We need to iterate through the queue while keeping track of the current time.
2. For each person in the queue, we will process their ticket requests.
3. If the current person is the target person (indexed by `k`), we need to be cautious about how many tickets we process to ensure that we correctly calculate their total time spent.
4. The loop will continue until we have determined how long it takes for the `k`-th person to finish buying their tickets.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of people, as we may need to check each person in the queue.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space for variables and counters.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // A person can buy up to the number of tickets they want, but we stop if they are the target 'k' person
            if (i <= k) {
                time += min(tickets[i], tickets[k]);
            } else {
                time += min(tickets[i], tickets[k] - 1);
            }
        }
        
        return time;
    }
};

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `time_needed_to_buy_tickets.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int timeRequiredToBuy(vector<int>& tickets, int k) {
        int time = 0;
        int n = tickets.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // A person can buy up to the number of tickets they want, but we stop if they are the target 'k' person
            if (i <= k) {
                time += min(tickets[i], tickets[k]);
            } else {
                time += min(tickets[i], tickets[k] - 1);
            }
        }
        
        return time;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> tickets = {2, 3, 2};
    int k = 2;
    int result = solution.timeRequiredToBuy(tickets, k);
    cout << "Time needed to buy tickets: " << result << endl; // Expected output: 6
    return 0;
}
```
