# **[Maximum Building Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-building-height/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
To maximize the height of buildings between given points while adhering to constraints, we have to find points where the height can be maximized without violating the increasing height rule from the leftmost to rightmost. The challenge includes dealing with the existing building heights and locations, which restrict where and how tall we can build new structures.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Preparation**: Start by adding two hypothetical points:
   - A point at the start with height 0 (i.e., (0, 0)).
   - A point at the end with height 0 (i.e., (length of area, 0)).
  
2. **Merge and Sort**: Create a list of points with their heights, including existing buildings and newly added points. Sort this list based on the position of the buildings.

3. **Forward Pass**: For each segment of buildings represented in the sorted list:
   - Track the maximum height possible in the segment.
   - Update potential heights based on a linear increase from the left.

4. **Backward Pass**: Repeat the process hand in hand with a backward traversal:
   - Calculate maximum heights moving from right to left, ensuring adjacent segments can respect the constraints from the right.

5. **Calculate Potential Maximum**: As you connect these segments, maintain a check on the maximum heights possible across all segments.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) (due to sorting the points).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (to hold the building points).
