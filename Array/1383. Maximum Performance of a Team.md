# **[Maximum Performance of a Team](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-performance-of-a-team/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves forming a team of engineers based on their efficiency and speed to achieve a maximum performance score. We are given a list of engineers defined by their speed and efficiency. The performance of a team is determined by the sum of the speeds of the engineers in the team multiplied by the minimum efficiency among those engineers. The constraints limit the number of engineers we can select, so we need to choose wisely to maximize this performance score. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structure**: Use vectors to store the pairs of speed and efficiency.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the engineers based on their efficiency in descending order. This allows us to consider higher efficiency engineers first, which will help maximize our performance score.
3. **Using a Min-Heap (Priority Queue)**: As we iterate through the sorted engineers, we use a min-heap to keep track of the selected speeds effectively. The purpose of the min-heap is to always maintain the speeds of the chosen engineers and efficiently manage the sum of these speeds.
4. **Performance Calculation**: After adding a new engineer's speed into the min-heap, we calculate the performance as the product of the current minimum efficiency (from the iterator) and the total speed of the engineers present in the heap.
5. **Consideration of Top k Engineers**: To optimize the performance further, we keep track of the maximum performance calculated during the iteration and return the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of engineers due to sorting and managing the min-heap operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the storage of the speed and efficiency pairs.
