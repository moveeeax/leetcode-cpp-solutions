# **[Cat and Mouse II](https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-mouse-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we have a game involving two players: a cat and a mouse, on a circular path represented by nodes. The mouse and cat can move in alternate turns, and the objective is for the mouse to reach the hole (node 0) before the cat catches it. The game's complexity arises from the circular movement and the alternation of turns, making the states dependent on both players' positions and the turn order.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve the problem optimally, we can utilize a graph-based approach with dynamic programming:
1. **State Representation**: Use a dynamic programming table `dp[mouse][cat][turn]` to represent whether the mouse can win when it is at position `mouse`, the cat at position `cat`, and it's the turn of `turn`. 
2. **Memoization**: Since states can overlap, we store results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations.
3. **Base Cases**:
   - If the mouse reaches the hole (node 0), it wins. So `dp[0][cat][turn] = true` for any `cat`.
   - If the cat catches the mouse, the cat wins. Thus, `dp[mouse][mouse][turn] = false` for any `turn`.
4. **Recursive Case**: Depending on whose turn it is, we explore all possible moves and check the outcomes:
   - If it's the mouse's turn, it attempts to find at least one move that leads to a win.
   - If it's the cat's turn, it must avoid all moves that allow the mouse to win.
5. **Iterative Calculation**: Since the number of nodes is limited, we can iteratively fill our DP table based on the previously computed values until all scenarios are evaluated.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^3), where N is the number of nodes, due to the triple nested loops for the states.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N^2), for the memoization storage of states.
