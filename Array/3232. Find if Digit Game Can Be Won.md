# **[Find if Digit Game Can Be Won](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-digit-game-can-be-won/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about evaluating whether the first player can win a game given a set of digits on a card. The players take turns to choose a digit, and the player who can keep playing by ensuring their chosen digit is less than or equal to `x` (where `x` is a value that halves with each turn) will keep playing until there are no valid options left. The goal of the first player is to ensure they maintain a playable digit for as long as possible compared to the second player.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To determine if the first player can win:
1. **Sort the Digits**: Start by sorting the possible playable digits in ascending order. This helps in efficiently checking which digits can be chosen based on the value of `x`.
2. **Iterate & Check Validity**: Iterate through the sorted digits, and for each digit:
   - If the digit is less than or equal to `x`, decrement `x` by half for the next round and proceed. 
   - If the digit is greater than `x`, the first player cannot choose that digit and would lose, hence return false.
3. **Player Turns**: Keep track of whose turn it is. If the first player has no more valid digits to choose during their turn, they lose.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of digits due to sorting.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are sorting in-place and not requiring additional storage for the digits after sorting.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWin(int currentPlayer, int x, vector<int>& digits) {
        sort(digits.begin(), digits.end());
        
        int n = digits.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (digits[i] > x) {
                return currentPlayer == 0 ? false : true; // current player can't play.
            }
            x /= 2; // Halve x for the next turn.
            currentPlayer = !currentPlayer; // Switch player.
        }
        return currentPlayer == 0; // First player played last if this returns true.
    }
    
    bool findWinner(vector<int>& digits) {
        return canWin(0, 10000, digits); // Assuming unlimited x starts at 10000, which is greater than any digit.
    }
};
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `digit_game.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

## **üìù Full Working Code (Local Execution)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canWin(int currentPlayer, int x, vector<int>& digits) {
        sort(digits.begin(), digits.end());
        
        int n = digits.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (digits[i] > x) {
                return currentPlayer == 0 ? false : true; // current player can't play.
            }
            x /= 2; // Halve x for the next turn.
            currentPlayer = !currentPlayer; // Switch player.
        }
        return currentPlayer == 0; // First player played last if this returns true.
    }
    
    bool findWinner(vector<int>& digits) {
        return canWin(0, 10000, digits); // Assuming unlimited x starts at 10000, which is greater than any digit.
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> digits = {1, 3, 4, 2}; // Example input
    bool result = solution.findWinner(digits); // Will evaluate if first player can win
    cout << (result ? "First player can win" : "First player cannot win") << endl; // Outputs result
    return 0;
}
