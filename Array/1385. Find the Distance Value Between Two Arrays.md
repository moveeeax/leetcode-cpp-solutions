# **[Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-distance-value-between-two-arrays/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine how many elements in one array (`arr1`) have a corresponding element in another array (`arr2`) such that the absolute difference between the two is strictly greater than a specified threshold (i.e., `d`). This can be conceptualized as counting "distanced" pairs between these two arrays. If `arr1` has an element `x`, we check every element `y` in `arr2` and we determine if `|x - y| > d`. The goal is to calculate how many such "distances" exist.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sort `arr2`**: This allows us to utilize binary search techniques, which will make checking the condition more efficient.
2. **Iterate through each element in `arr1`**: For each element, we'll determine the closest elements in `arr2` using binary search.
3. **Utilize `std::lower_bound`**: This allows us to find indices where elements that do not satisfy the distance condition start and end. Specifically:
   - Calculate the lower bound for `arr1[i] - d` to find the smallest index where the difference between `arr1[i]` and any element in `arr2` is greater than `d`.
   - Calculate the upper bound for `arr1[i] + d` to find the largest index where the absolute difference could still be considered minimal.

4. **Count the valid elements**: From the indices obtained through binary search, you can easily determine how many elements in `arr2` do not satisfy the distance condition.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log m), where n is the length of `arr1` and m is the length of `arr2`. Sorting `arr2` takes O(m log m), and for each of the n elements in `arr1`, we are performing binary search which is O(log m).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if we do not include the space used for sorting, as the only extra space used is for variables.

public:
    int findTheDistanceValue(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2, int d) {
        sort(arr2.begin(), arr2.end());
        int count = 0;

        for (int x : arr1) {
            // Finding the index of the first element in arr2 that is not less than (x - d)
            auto lower = lower_bound(arr2.begin(), arr2.end(), x - d);
            // Finding the index of the first element in arr2 that is greater than (x + d)
            auto upper = upper_bound(arr2.begin(), arr2.end(), x + d);

            // If lower and upper are equal, it means all elements in arr2 are within the distance
            if (lower == upper) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
