# **[Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem can be approached by examining how many ways we can pair elements from two arrays such that their respective values produce a specific score when added together. The goal is to maximize the number of pairs while keeping the total score the same. Therefore, we need to efficiently count how many operations (pairings) can be made without changing the resultant score. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Identification of Scores**: For each element in array `A`, it can be paired with an element from array `B` to affect the "score".
2. **Operation Count**: We need to find out how many elements in array `B` can contribute to the score formed by an element in `A`, and vice versa. This can be done using a hash map (or map).
3. **Using Maps**: 
   - Count occurrences of each value in `A`.
   - Count occurrences of each value in `B`.
   - For each unique score possible from `A + B`, compute the number of operations that can generate the same score by analyzing the min counts from both maps.
4. **Maximize Operations**: Iterate through all scores and calculate the total operations possible based on the counts. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n is the size of array `A` and m is the size of array `B`. We might have to iterate through both arrays to build our frequency maps and then iterate through them again to calculate possible operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) as we are storing the frequencies of the values in separate maps.
