# **[Maximum Number of Weeks for Which You Can Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-weeks-for-which-you-can-work/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of weeks we can work based on the number of tasks we have each week in a list called `milestones`. The main restriction is that we can skip a certain number of weeks equal to the total tasks we have minus the tasks we completed. The goal is to maximize the number of weeks worked without exceeding the available number of tasks plus the number of weeks we can afford to skip.  

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sum the Total Tasks**: Calculate the total number of tasks available. This gives us an upper limit on how many tasks can be worked through in any given number of weeks.
2. **Calculate the Current Number of Weeks**: The length of the `milestones` array gives the total weeks we are considering.
3. **Determine Workable Weeks**: For `n` weeks, if we can freely skip tasks, the maximum number of weeks we can work is determined by:
   - If the total tasks are less than or equal to the total weeks, we can work that many weeks.
   - If we have more tasks than the weeks, we can work on all weeks and then, based on how many tasks are available, continue working based on the number of tasks minus the number of weeks skipped.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - where n is the number of weeks. We iterate through the milestones to sum tasks, which takes linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - we are using a constant amount of space for variables.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWeeks(vector<int>& milestones) {
        long totalTasks = 0;
        int maxTasks = 0;

        for (int tasks : milestones) {
            totalTasks += tasks;
            maxTasks = max(maxTasks, tasks);
        }
        
        int weeks = milestones.size();
        // The maximum number of weeks we can work is one of two situations
        if (totalTasks <= weeks) {
            return totalTasks; // We can work as many weeks as the number of tasks
        } else {
            // We can work for all weeks and the excess tasks give us the remaining weeks
            return weeks + (totalTasks - maxTasks) - (weeks - 1);
        }
    }
};
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `MaximumNumberOfWeeks.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
