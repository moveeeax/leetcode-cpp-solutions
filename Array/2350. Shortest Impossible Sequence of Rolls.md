# **[Shortest Impossible Sequence of Rolls](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-impossible-sequence-of-rolls/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks us to find the length of the shortest impossible sequence of rolls, given the results of some rolls of a fair 6-sided dice. An impossible sequence is defined as any sequence that cannot be achieved by throwing this dice a certain number of times. The goal is to determine the smallest integer `x` such that there is no combination of the rolls that can sum to `x`. 

To address this, we profit from the property of consecutive sums. If we can create all sequences of sums from `1` to `n`, then the first impossible integer must be `n + 1`. If any integer within this range is missing from the results of our rolls, it directly indicates an impossible sequence.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting Rolls**: Begin by sorting the rolls that we have. This makes it easier to keep track of the sums we can create step-by-step.
2. **Finding the Smallest Impossible Sequence**: Initialize a variable `smallest` to `1`. This variable represents the smallest sum that we cannot currently form.
3. **Iterate through Rolls**:
   - For each roll, check if it is greater than `smallest`. If it is, then `smallest` is our answer because we cannot form it with the given rolls.
   - If the roll is less than or equal to `smallest`, add it to `smallest`. The reasoning is that we now can create all sums up to `smallest + roll - 1`.
4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all rolls, if we find that all rolls can contribute to forming sums, then return `smallest`.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of rolls.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of additional space.
