# **[Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-smooth-descent-periods-of-a-stock/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves analyzing stock prices to determine the number of smooth descent periods. A smooth descent period is defined as a period during which consecutive stock prices decline by exactly 1. The goal is to count these periods starting from each day‚Äôs stock price. Therefore, we can visualize and maintain a count of the days where the price on the current day leads to a decline compared to the previous day.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start by declaring a variable to store the total count of smooth descent periods.
2. **Iterate through the stock prices**: Use a loop to go through each stock price, starting from the second day.
3. **Count Smooth Descents**: 
   - If the current stock price is one less than the previous day‚Äôs price, increments a counter that tracks how long the current descent period is.
   - If not, reset this counter to 0.
4. **Update Total Count**: 
   - Add the current counter (which indicates the number of consecutive descent days including the current day) to the total count.
5. **Return the Total**: After processing all the stock prices, return the total count of smooth descent periods.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the prices array, as we only go through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

            if (prices[i] == prices[i - 1] - 1) {
                currentPeriodCount++; // Extend the current descent period
            } else {
                currentPeriodCount = 1; // Reset for a new period
            }
            totalPeriods += currentPeriodCount; // Add the current periods to the total count
        }
