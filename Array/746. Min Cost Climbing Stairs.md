# **[Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around finding the minimum cost to step to the top of a staircase where each step has a specified cost. We can choose to start at step 0 or step 1. As we climb, we have the option to jump either 1 or 2 steps at a time, allowing for flexibility in our climbing path. The goal is to efficiently compute the minimum total cost associated with reaching the top, considering that each step may have different associated costs.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To tackle this problem, we will utilize a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach step `i`. The recursion relies on the fact that to reach step `i`, we could either come from step `i-1` or step `i-2`, which gives us the following recurrence relation:
- `dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + cost[i], dp[i-2] + cost[i])`.

However, since we only need the last two states of the `dp` table at any time, we can optimize the space complexity by only storing two variables instead of the entire array. Thus, we track `prev1` (cost to reach the last step) and `prev2` (cost to reach the step before last).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We iterate through the costs array to compute the minimum cost.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We only store a fixed number of variables for the calculations, independent of input size.

            int current = min(prev1 + cost[i - 1], prev2 + cost[i - 2]);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }
        
        return prev1; // The minimum cost to reach the top step
