# **[Stone Game IX](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-ix/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem revolves around a strategic game played with stones, where two players alternately remove stones. Each stone has a certain value which is an integer, and players can take stones based on certain game rules. The goal is to determine whether the first player can guarantee a victory no matter how the second player plays.

The unique twist in this game is linked to the modulo operation with `3`. For example, if a player makes a move that results in a certain sum of stone values, that move affects the options available in subsequent turns based on the modulo value of that sum. Players need to make sure that they can force a win based on the outcomes determined by the modulo.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we need to count how many stones have values that are `0`, `1`, and `2` when taken modulo `3`. This gives us an understanding of the available options for the players.
2. **Game Logic**: 
   - If there are no stones giving a `0` value, the outcome depends heavily on the numbers of `1` and `2` type stones.
   - If there are stones resulting in a `0`, we need to check the counts of the other stones (i.e., `1` and `2`). The player needs to ensure that they don‚Äôt get stuck in a losing position by leaving the opponent the ability to keep playing optimally against them.
3. **Conditions**: 
   - If we have at least one `1` and at least one `2`, the first player can secure a win by controlling the number of stones taken.
   - If the counts are imbalanced in a way that allows the second player to always counteract the first player, the outcome shifts against the first player.

The solution leverages these insights to compute the result in constant time based on the counts of stones.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of stones (we iterate through them once to count).  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only store a few integer counts.
