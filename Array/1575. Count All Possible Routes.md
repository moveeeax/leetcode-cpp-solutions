# **[Count All Possible Routes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-possible-routes/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to count the number of ways to traverse between a number of cities, each of which has a certain amount of fuel. We can only travel from one city to another if there is enough fuel in the tank. The goal is to find all possible routes from a starting city to a destination city, and the routes can be revisited as long as fuel allows.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Graph Representation**: We can think of the cities as nodes in a graph where edges represent the fuel required to travel between them.
2. **Recursion with Memoization**: Since the number of routes can grow exponentially, a recursive approach that explores all paths, combined with memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations, will be efficient.
3. **Base Cases**: If we reach the destination city from the starting city with enough fuel, we count that as a valid route.
4. **Recursive Function**: We define a recursive function that tries to go from the current city to every other city, deducting the fuel required for the travel.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * (F + C)), where N is the number of cities, F is the maximum amount of fuel available, and C is the total number of calls made including memoization.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * F), to store results in the cache for memoization.
