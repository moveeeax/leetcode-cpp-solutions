# **[Distance Between Bus Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/distance-between-bus-stops/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem asks to find the distance between two bus stops on a circular route. Given an array representing the distances between bus stops, we need to calculate the distance between two given stops. Since the path is circular, the distance can be computed in two ways: by summing the distances in one direction and by taking the complementary distance in the opposite direction.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Calculate Total Distance**: Start by calculating the total distance around the entire circular route by summing up all the distances in the input array.
2. **Calculate Forward Distance**: Determine the distance from the start stop to the end stop by summing the distances in the forward direction using the indices of the two stops.
3. **Calculate Backward Distance**: The backward distance can be obtained by subtracting the forward distance from the total distance.
4. **Return Minimum Distance**: The final distance between the two bus stops would be the minimum of the forward and backward distances.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of bus stops (i.e., the size of the distance array). This is because we need to sum the distances to get the total.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space for our variables.

            totalDistance += distance[i];
            if (i >= min(start, destination) && i < max(start, destination)) {
                forwardDistance += distance[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate backward distance
        int backwardDistance = totalDistance - forwardDistance;
        
        // Return the minimum distance
        return min(forwardDistance, backwardDistance);
