# **[Find Players With Zero or One Losses](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The goal of this problem is to identify players in a competitive setting based on the number of losses they've recorded. Each player has a unique identifier (a number) and can either win or lose a game. If a player loses a game, they accumulate a loss, and we need to maintain a count of these losses.

The problem provides us with a list of matches, where each match is represented by two players: the winner and the loser. Hence, for each match, we need to increment the loss count for the losing player. 

After processing all matches, we need to find:
- Players who did not lose any matches (zero losses).
- Players who lost exactly one match.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialize Data Structures**: Use an unordered map to count the losses of each player. 
2. **Process Each Match**: For each match, increment the loss count for the losing player.
3. **Extract Results**: After processing all matches, extract the players with zero or one loss. 
4. **Sort Results**: To fulfill the output requirements, sort the lists of players who had zero or one loss before returning them.
5. **Return the Result**: Return the results in the required format.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of players, due to sorting the final lists.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of unique players that recorded losses.
