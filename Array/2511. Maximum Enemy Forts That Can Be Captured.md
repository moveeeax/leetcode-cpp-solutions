# **[Maximum Enemy Forts That Can Be Captured](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-enemy-forts-that-can-be-captured/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of enemy forts (`1`s) that can be captured by our army (represented by a `0`) in a straight line without being obstructed by our own forts (represented by a `-1`). The forts are represented as an array of integers, and our capturing potential extends in both directions (left and right) from each `0` until we hit either the boundaries of the array or our own fort.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. Iterate through the array to locate each `0` representing our fort.
2. For each `0`, extend left and right to count the number of `1`s (enemy forts) until you hit a `-1` (our fort) or the edge of the array.
3. Maintain a maximum count of enemy forts that can be captured.
4. Return the maximum count after evaluating all possible positions for `0`s.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `forts` array since we only traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables for counting and storing the maximum.

            if (forts[i] == 0) {
                int leftCapture = 0;
                int rightCapture = 0;
                
                // Count forts to the left
                for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0 && forts[j] != -1; --j) {
                    if (forts[j] == 1) leftCapture++;
                }
                
                // Count forts to the right
                for (int j = i + 1; j < forts.size() && forts[j] != -1; ++j) {
                    if (forts[j] == 1) rightCapture++;
                }
                
                maxCapture = max(maxCapture, leftCapture + rightCapture);
            }

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `maximum_enemy_forts.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `MaximumEnemyFortsThatCanBeCaptured` class inside `main()`**  
3. **Include necessary headers**: `#include <vector>` and `#include <iostream>`  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
