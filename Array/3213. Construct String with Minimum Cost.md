# **[Construct String with Minimum Cost](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-with-minimum-cost/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to construct a string `s` of length `n` where we can choose each character from a given string `chars`, and the cost for choosing each character is specified in an array `costs`. The goal is to ensure that the resulting string is not only formed from the characters provided but also minimizes the total cost associated with selecting characters from the `costs` array. 

The challenge arises from the need to potentially repeat characters while maintaining the minimum cost. If we wish to create strings where continuous characters must not be the same, we must consider how to manage switches or repetitions effectively to maintain a low overall cost.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initialization**: Start by determining the string's length `n`, the list of characters `chars`, and their corresponding costs.
2. **Cost Management**: As we build the string character by character, maintain a running total of the minimum cost at each position.
3. **Greedy Selection**: For each character position, select the character from `chars` that results in the current minimum cost while also ensuring it does not repeat the previously selected character from the string.
4. **Constructing Result**: Accumulate characters into a result string that adheres to the cost and repetition constraints.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string since we use a single pass to construct the result.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of input.
