# **[Subsequences with a Unique Middle Mode I](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsequences-with-a-unique-middle-mode-i/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to determine the number of subsequences within a given array that possess a unique middle mode. A subsequence is formed by deleting some or none of the elements from the original array while preserving their relative order. The middle mode is defined as the value that appears the most frequently in a subset of the array. 

To address this problem, we first need to analyze possible subsequences of the input array. For each subsequence, we need to calculate the frequency of each number and check if there is only one mode. A mode is considered unique if it appears more times than any other number in that subsequence. 

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Counting Frequencies:** We first calculate the frequency of numbers in the input array using a map (or unordered map).
2. **Check Subsequences:** For every unique integer:
   - We will consider it as a potential middle mode.
   - For each number, we'll find subsequences formed only by numbers that do not compete with our candidate middle mode.
   - We will calculate the number of times the candidate can be taken in combinations to ensure the total frequency of our mode remains higher than others.
3. **Final Count:** We tally the total valid subsequences that satisfy the unique middle mode condition.

This involves combinatorial counting through dynamic programming or backtracking to explore valid subsequences. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n) in the worst case due to the subsequence generation. However, we can improve this by considering counts directly rather than generating full subsequences.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing frequency and possibly for recursion stack in the case of backtracking.
