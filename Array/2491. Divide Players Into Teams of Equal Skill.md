# **[Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-players-into-teams-of-equal-skill/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem is about dividing players into two teams such that the sum of the skill levels in both teams are equal. Each player's skill level is given in a list. The challenge is to determine if it is possible to achieve this division and, if so, calculate the total skill level of team one based on the allowed division of players.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting Skills**: First, we sort the skill levels in ascending order. This allows us to consider the highest and lowest skill levels while pairing players effectively.
2. **Pairing Players**: By pairing the players from opposite ends of the sorted list (start and end), we attempt to make the teams equal. For instance, pairing the lowest skilled player with the highest.
3. **Checking Skill Pair Sums**: We check if the sum of skills of paired players is the same for all these pairs. This assures us that we can divide them into two equally skilled teams.
4. **Calculating Team Skill Sum**: If all pairs have the same skill sum, we multiply that value by the number of pairs (which is half of the total player count) to derive the final skill level for a team.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting of the skill levels, where n is the number of players.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we use constant space aside from the input list.

            if (skill[i] + skill[n - 1 - i] != teamSkill) {
                return -1; // Not possible to form teams with equal skill
