# **[Parallel Courses III](https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses-iii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves calculating the minimum time required to complete all courses in a curriculum, given that courses can be taken in parallel but have dependencies on each other. Each course can be taken only after all of its prerequisites are completed. Our goal is to determine how many semesters are needed to complete all courses.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can conceptualize the courses and their dependencies as a directed graph where:
- Each course is a node.
- An edge from node A to node B indicates that course A must be completed before course B can be taken.

We will use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting to determine the order in which courses can be completed, combined with a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to count the number of semesters required.

1. **Graph Representation**: Construct a graph to represent the courses and their dependencies using an adjacency list.
  
2. **In-degree Calculation**: For each course, maintain an in-degree count to track the number of prerequisites for each course.

3. **BFS for Topological Sort**: Start with all courses that have an in-degree of zero (meaning no prerequisites). Process these courses by reducing the in-degree of their dependents and adding them to the BFS queue when their in-degree becomes zero.

4. **Count Semesters**: Every time we process a set of courses (the BFS level), we increase the semester count.

5. **Completion Check**: If the number of courses processed equals the total number of courses, we return the semester count; otherwise, completion is impossible.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites (edges).
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for storing the graph.
