# **[Delete Columns to Make Sorted II](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted-ii/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to identify and delete certain columns from a given list of strings, such that the remaining strings remain sorted in non-decreasing order when read in lexicographical order from top to bottom. The strings can have duplicates, and we can delete multiple columns at once, but we also want to keep the maximum number of columns intact. 

The challenge arises when we have consecutive columns that contribute to the same sorted order. Thus, if we find a column that breaks the sorted order, we need to check if subsequent columns are also necessary to delete.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Sorting Mechanism**: We must evaluate columns one by one and keep track of whether they continue to preserve the sorted order when considered together. If a column violates the order, mark it for deletion.
  
2. **Marking for Deletion**: Use a boolean vector to track columns that need to be removed after iterating through the strings. We can simplify our logic by identifying "marks" during the sorting check and then directly assess which columns should be deleted.

3. **Construct the Result**: Finally, rebuild the strings excluding the marked columns and return their count. 

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the strings, since we must evaluate each column against each string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), for the boolean array that tracks which columns to remove.

                if (deleteCol[j]) break; // skip if this column is already marked for deletion
                if (A[i][j] < A[i - 1][j]) {
                    deleteCol[j] = true; // mark the column for deletion if the order is violated

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `delete_columns_to_make_sorted_ii.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& A) {
        int n = A.size(), m = A[0].size();
        vector<bool> deleteCol(m, false);
        
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
                if (deleteCol[j]) break; // skip if this column is already marked for deletion
                if (A[i][j] < A[i - 1][j]) {
                    deleteCol[j] = true; // mark the column for deletion if the order is violated
                }
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            if (deleteCol[j]) count++; // count the columns marked for deletion
        }
        
        return count; // return the total count of columns to be deleted
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<string> input = {"cba", "daf", "ghi"};
    int result = solution.minDeletionSize(input);
    cout << result << endl; // Expected output: 1
    return 0;
}
