# **[Rabbits in Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/rabbits-in-forest/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
In this problem, we want to determine the minimum number of rabbits that must exist in a forest based on the responses given by them. Each rabbit provides an integer indicating how many rabbits share the same color as itself. This means that the number of responses may not be directly the number of rabbits present, as one rabbit could be reporting for other identical-color rabbits. 

To understand how we can derive the minimum number of rabbits, we need to consider that if a rabbit says there are `x` other rabbits (indicating `x + 1` total including itself), there could be a varying number of rabbits in that group (such as 1, 2, or more). Thus, we will need to account for all responses and determine the total count of rabbits based on such groupings.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Count Responses**: Utilize a hash map to count how many times each number appears in the responses. Each number indicates that there are `x` other rabbits of the same color, resulting in `x + 1` rabbits being present for each occurrence of `x`.

2. **Calculate Minimum Rabbits**: For a specific response of `x` (which counts as `x + 1` total rabbits):
   - Determine how many complete groups of rabbits can be formed: If `count` responses indicate there are `x` other rabbits, the number of complete groups is `count / (x + 1)`, and we take the ceiling of this quotient to handle cases where there are partial groups.
   - Multiply the number of complete groups by `x + 1` to find the number of rabbits that must exist for those responses.

3. **Sum Total Rabbits**: Accumulate all these minimum counts across different responses to get the final answer.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rabbits (responses), since we are counting each response and iterating through them exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique responses since we are using a map to hold counts of responses.
