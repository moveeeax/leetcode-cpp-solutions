# **[Minimum Cost of a Path With Special Roads](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-of-a-path-with-special-roads/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to move from the starting point at (0,0) to a target point (a, b) on a grid. There are two ways to navigate to the target point: moving through the grid using the standard right and down steps (at a cost defined by the cost of moving to the target point) or special roads that connect certain points specified in an input. Each special road has a starting and ending point, along with its associated cost. The challenge lies in determining the optimal route that combines regular movements and special roads to minimize the overall cost.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is ideal for graph-based problems with weighted edges. We will represent the points in the grid, including the special roads, as nodes in a graph. The edges between nodes will represent the costs of moving from one point to another, either via standard movement or through special roads.

1. **Graph Representation**: Model the grid points and special roads as nodes and edges. Each node corresponds to reachable grid coordinates, and special roads will be treated as direct edges with costs.

2. **Priority Queue**: We will utilize a priority queue to explore the node with the current minimum cost first, adding to the final path cost accordingly.

3. **Cost Tracking**: Maintain a distance array to track the minimum cost to reach each point, updating it as we find cheaper paths during the exploration.

4. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Start from the origin (0,0) and use Dijkstra's algorithm to traverse through the grid and special roads, updating costs until we reach the target point (a,b).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O((n + m) log(n + m)), where n is the number of points defined by the grid dimensions and m is the number of special roads. The logarithmic factor arises from the priority queue operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) for storing the distance array and the graph structure in terms of edges.
