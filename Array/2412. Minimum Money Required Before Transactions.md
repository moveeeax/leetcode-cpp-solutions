# **[Minimum Money Required Before Transactions](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-money-required-before-transactions/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires determining the minimum amount of money that is necessary to complete a series of transactions, where the transactions may involve both buying and selling items. Each transaction has a profit or loss associated with it, and before completing transactions, we might need to have an initial amount of money to ensure we can cover any losses. The transactions consist of pairs of integers where the first number represents the loss (a negative number) and the second represents the profit (a positive number). Our goal is to find the minimum initial amount of money needed before we start the transactions.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Understand the Transactions**: Each transaction can either incur a loss or yield a profit. If we have an initial amount before performing the transactions, it must be sufficient to cover any losses.
2. **Track Minimum Money Required**: As we loop through the list of transactions, we need to maintain a running total of money that indicates whether we are currently in profit or loss.
3. **Adjust for Negative Balances**: If at any point our total falls below zero, we need to keep track of how much the initial amount needs to be adjusted to ensure we can perform the next transaction without going bankrupt.
4. **Return the Required Minimum**: By the end of the transactions, we will have calculated the minimum initial amount that guarantees the transactions can be completed successfully.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Where n is the number of transactions, since we go through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We are using a constant amount of extra space for tracking the sums.

            int loss = transaction[0];
            int profit = transaction[1];
            if (loss < 0) {
                totalRequired += -loss;  // Increment required amount by the absolute loss.
            } else {
                totalLoss += loss;  // Track total losses.
            }
        }
        
        return (totalRequired - totalLoss < 0) ? totalRequired : totalRequired - totalLoss;
    }
};
