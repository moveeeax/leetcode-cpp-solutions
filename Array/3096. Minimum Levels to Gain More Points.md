# **[Minimum Levels to Gain More Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-levels-to-gain-more-points/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves determining the minimum number of levels a player must reach to accumulate a given target score. Each level provides a certain number of points, and the player can choose any combination of levels to reach the target. The goal is to find the least number of levels required such that the total points from those levels are at least equal to the target score.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach that sorts the levels based on their points in descending order. By selecting the levels with the highest points first, we minimize the number of levels needed to reach the target score. We keep track of the accumulated score and the count of levels selected until we reach or exceed the target.

1. **Sort Levels**: Sort the array of points from levels in descending order.
2. **Iterate Through Levels**: Start adding points from the highest level until the total points are sufficient to meet or exceed the target score. Count the number of levels used.
3. **Return the Count**: If the target is met, return the count of levels used; otherwise, return -1 indicating the target cannot be reached.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sorting of levels where n is the number of levels.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we only use a few additional variables for counting and accumulating points.

        sort(levels.rbegin(), levels.rend()); // Sort levels in descending order
        int totalPoints = 0;
        int levelCount = 0;
        
        for (int points : levels) {
            totalPoints += points;
            levelCount++;
            if (totalPoints >= target) {
                return levelCount;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Not enough points after considering all levels

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `minimum_levels.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `MinimumLevels` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**

        int levelCount = 0;
        
        for (int points : levels) {
            totalPoints += points;
            levelCount++;
            if (totalPoints >= target) {
                return levelCount;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Not enough points after considering all levels
    }

int main() {
    MinimumLevels ml;
    
    int target;
    cout << "Enter target score: ";
    cin >> target;
    
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of levels: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<int> levels(n);
    cout << "Enter points for each level: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> levels[i];
    }
    
    int result = ml.minLevels(target, levels);
    cout << "Minimum levels required: " << result << endl;
