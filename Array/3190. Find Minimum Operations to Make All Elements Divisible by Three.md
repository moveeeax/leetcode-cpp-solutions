# **[Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-operations-to-make-all-elements-divisible-by-three/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations to make all elements in an array divisible by three. Each operation can either subtract 1 (to potentially decrease a number to the nearest lower multiple of three) or add 1 (to increase a number to the nearest higher multiple of three). Every number has a specific remainder when divided by three, leading us to focus on the remainders of 0, 1, and 2. To minimize operations, we can analyze how each remainder affects our choices.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initial Remainder Calculation**: First, calculate the remainder of each element when divided by three.
2. **Operation Counting**: Use a counter to count how many numbers yield each remainder (0, 1, 2).
3. **Operation Decisions**:
   - Numbers with a remainder of 0 are already divisible by three.
   - For numbers with a remainder of 1, we need to add 2 to make them divisible (one operation).
   - For numbers with a remainder of 2, we need to subtract 1 to make them divisible (one operation).
4. **Result Extraction**: The answer would simply be the sum of all operations needed based on counts from remainders 1 and 2.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array (as we iterate through the array only once).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (constant space used for counting operations).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int cnt1 = 0, cnt2 = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int remainder = num % 3;
            if (remainder == 1) {
                cnt1++;
            } else if (remainder == 2) {
                cnt2++;
            }
        }
        return cnt1 + 2 * cnt2; // Operations for 1s and 2s
    }
