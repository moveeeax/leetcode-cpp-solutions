# **[Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-winner-on-a-tic-tac-toe-game/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The task is to determine the winner of a Tic Tac Toe game based on a sequence of moves made by two players, 'A' and 'B'. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and players take turns marking a square. The player that first gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all squares are filled and there's no winner, the game is a draw. The main challenge is to efficiently determine the winner after the sequence of moves is complete.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Data Structure**: Use an array to represent the Tic Tac Toe board. The board can be modeled as a 3x3 grid, which is essentially a 2D array or a flat array of size 9.
2. **Simulate the Moves**: Loop through the list of moves and update the board accordingly. Keep track of the number of moves made so far.
3. **Check for Winner**:
   - After each move, check if the current player has satisfied any winning condition.
   - Winning conditions include three marks in a row for each row, column, and both diagonals.
4. **Determine Result**: If a player has won, return their name; if all moves are made without a winner, return "Draw".

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for checking the condition after each move since there are only a fixed number of winning conditions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for using a fixed-size board.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `tictactoe.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `Solution` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
