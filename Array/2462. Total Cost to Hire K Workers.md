# **[Total Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-cost-to-hire-k-workers/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem requires us to calculate the total cost to hire `k` workers from a list, where each worker has a cost associated with them. The challenge arises from the fact that we must consider the hiring process in a way that allows us to hire workers at a minimum cost while adhering to a specific order of hiring. We can only hire workers from either end of the list at any time. Therefore, to determine the total cost effectively, an efficient strategy is needed, utilizing a priority queue (min-heap) to always get the lowest-cost worker available from the ends. This ensures we minimize our expenses while hiring.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
1. **Initial Setup**: Start by initializing a min-heap (priority queue) to store the costs of hiring workers, as well as a counter to track how many workers have been hired.
2. **Heap Construction**: Add the first `k` workers into the min-heap. Gradually expand this by pushing the next worker into the heap only when we start hiring.
3. **Hiring Process**: Remove the worker with the least cost from the heap and add their cost to our total cost. After this, we can push the next worker from either end (if available) back into the heap to keep our options open.
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until we have hired `k` workers.
5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the total cost accumulated after hiring `k` workers.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(k log k) - This arises due to the operations with the priority queue, with each insertion and removal taking O(log k).
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) - This is the maximum space used by the priority queue to store at most `k` workers at any time.
