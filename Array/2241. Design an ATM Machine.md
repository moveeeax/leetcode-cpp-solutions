# **[Design an ATM Machine](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-an-atm-machine/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The objective is to create a class that simulates an ATM machine. The ATM can accept a certain amount in specific denominations (i.e., 20, 50, 100) and can dispense cash in these denominations as requested by the user, provided that the ATM has enough cash available. The class will also keep track of the total amount of cash in the ATM and should allow for withdrawal transactions while adhering to any restrictions based on the current cash in the ATM and the limits of withdrawal in each denomination.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
To design the ATM machine:
1. **Data Members**: We will maintain:
   - An array to keep track of the number of bills for each denomination (20, 50, 100).
   - A constant for each denomination to easily convert between indices and actual currency values.
   - A variable to keep track of the total amount of cash in the ATM.

2. **Methods**:
   - `deposit(int[] banknotes)`: This method will accept an array representing the number of banknotes for each category (20, 50, 100) and update the internal state of the ATM.
   - `withdraw(int amount)`: This method will allow for cash withdrawal by ensuring:
     - The requested amount is less than or equal to what the ATM has.
     - The cash can be dispensed using available denominations without exceeding the amount requested. 
   - Both methods will update the internal state accordingly and respond with proper status messages (e.g., failure or success of transactions).

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for both deposit and withdraw operations, as they involve simple arithmetic and array manipulations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we only use a finite-sized array and a few integers.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ LeetCode Submission**  
```cpp
class ATM {
public:
    int banknotes[3] = {0}; // Store counts for [20, 50, 100]
    const int denominations[3] = {20, 50, 100}; // Denomination values
    
    ATM() {
    }
    
    void deposit(vector<int> banknotes) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            this->banknotes[i] += banknotes[i];
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> withdraw(int amount) {
        vector<int> result(3, 0); // Result array for the number of banknotes to withdraw
        int totalWithdrawn = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i >= 0; i--) { // Start from the largest denomination
            if (amount <= 0) break; // Stop if no amount is left to withdraw
            int needed = amount / denominations[i]; // Calculate how many of this denomination are needed
            int available = banknotes[i]; // Check how many are currently available
            
            // Take the minimum of needed or available
            int toWithdraw = min(needed, available);
            result[i] = toWithdraw; // Store the number to withdraw
            totalWithdrawn += toWithdraw * denominations[i]; // Update the total withdrawn
            amount -= toWithdraw * denominations[i]; // Decrease amount
        }
        
        if (amount > 0) { // If we could not dispense the full amount, revert changes
            return {-1}; // Indicating failure
        }

        // Update the banknotes after successful withdrawal
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            banknotes[i] -= result[i];
        }

        return result; // Return the successful withdrawal
    }
};
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Locally**  
### **‚úÖ Steps**  
1. **Create a file**: `ATM.cpp`  
2. **Wrap the `ATM` class** inside `main()`  
3. **Include necessary headers**  
4. **Handle input/output for local execution**  
5. **Compile and run the program**
