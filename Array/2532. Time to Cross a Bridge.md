# **[Time to Cross a Bridge](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-to-cross-a-bridge/description/)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding**  
### **üìå Intuition**  
The problem involves a bridge that can support a specific number of cars at any one time, each with its own time to cross the bridge. Our goal is to determine the total time taken for all cars to cross the bridge without exceeding the limit of cars allowed on the bridge at the same time.

### **üöÄ Approach**  
- We maintain a priority queue (min-heap) to track the times when each car will finish crossing the bridge.
- We iterate through each car, using the following steps:
  - Before pushing a new car onto the bridge, we pop the cars from the queue that would have finished crossing by the time the next car is ready to start.
  - We push the current car onto the queue with the calculated finish time.
- Finally, we must ensure that any remaining cars in the queue are accounted for in the total time.

### **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k), where n is the number of cars and k is the maximum number of cars that can be on the bridge.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), to store the crossing times of the cars currently on the bridge in the priority queue.

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> cars = {7, 4, 5, 6};
    int bridgeLength = 2;
    int weight = 10;
    int result = solution.timeToCrossBridge(bridgeLength, weight, cars);
    
    cout << result << endl; // Expected output based on sample input
    return 0;
